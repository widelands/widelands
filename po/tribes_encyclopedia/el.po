#. Helptexts
#. ---------
#. Helptexts are used in the Tribal Encyclopedia to give the users some basic
#. information and lore about units.
#. They are optional and defined in a ``helptexts`` subtable in the unit's
#. listing.
#. Example for a building:
#. .. code-block:: lua
#. buildings = {
#. {
#. name = "barbarians_ax_workshop",
#. helptexts = {
#. Lore helptext for a barbarian production site: Ax Workshop
#. lore = pgettext("barbarians_building", "‘A new warrior’s ax brings forth
#. the best in its wielder – or the worst in its maker.’"),
#. Lore author helptext for a barbarian production site: Ax Workshop
#. lore_author = pgettext("barbarians_building", "An old Barbarian proverb<br>
#. meaning that you need to take some risks sometimes."),
#. Purpose helptext for a barbarian production site: Ax Workshop
#. purpose = pgettext("barbarians_building", "Produces axes, sharp axes and
#. broad axes."),
#. Note helptext for a barbarian production site: Ax Workshop
#. note = pgettext("barbarians_building", "The Barbarian ax workshop is the
#. intermediate production site in a series of three buildings. It is enhanced
#. from the metal workshop but doesn’t require additional qualification for
#. the worker."),
#. performance = {
#. Performance helptext for a barbarian production site: Ax Workshop, part 1
#. pgettext("barbarians_building", "If all needed wares are delivered in time,
#. this building can produce each type of ax in about %s on
#. average."):bformat(ngettext("%d second", "%d seconds", 57):bformat(57)),
#. Performance helptext for a barbarian production site: Ax Workshop, part 2
#. pgettext("barbarians_building", "All three weapons take the same time for
#. making, but the required raw materials vary.")
#. }
#. },
#. ...
#. },
#. immovables {
#. ...
#. },
#. wares {
#. ...
#. },
#. workers {
#. ...
#. }
#. }
#. * All units should have a ``purpose`` helptext, but this is not enforced by
#. the engine.
#. * Empty helptexts are allowed, although they will log a warning to the
#. console to
#. help you find missing helptexts.
#. * ``lore``, ``lore_author`` and ``note`` are only used by buildings,
#. ``performance`` is only used by training site and production site
#. buildings.
#. * The tribe’s scouting building should additionally define a
#. ``no_scouting_building_connected``
#. text which will be shown in the UI when the Send Scout To Flag button is
#. disabled for lack
#. of a connected scout’s house/hut.
#. * We recommend that you use ``pgettext`` to disambiguate the strings for
#. the different tribes.
#. * To make life easier for our translators, you can split long helptexts
#. into multiple entries
#. as with the ``performance`` example above.
#. The helptexts are then joined by the engine.
#. In our example, we will get *"If all needed wares are delivered in time,
#. this building can produce each type of ax in about 57 seconds on average.
#. All three weapons take the same time for making, but the required raw
#. materials vary."*
#. TODO(matthiakl): only for savegame compatibility with 1.0, do not use.
#. For formatting time strings
#. Image file paths for this tribe's road and waterway textures
#. Wares positions in wares windows.
#. This also gives us the information which wares the tribe uses.
#. Each subtable is a column in the wares windows.
