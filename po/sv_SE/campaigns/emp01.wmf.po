msgid " \"What has become of our Empire? I really ask this question - why did my king forbid me from fighting against that monsterous barbarian tribe, who first acted as a peaceful friend and then attacked my army in the darkest night.<br> I was assigned to patrol on our northern frontier, which lies near the Galdin Mountains in a great, beautiful and ancient forest, with an army of 150 men. Soon we met a barbarian tribe, which at first was friendly. A few of my men even traded with them and their kids came to us, to admire our clean and tidy uniforms and weapons.<br> But in our fifth night in that region, they attacked us without a reason. I lost dozens of good men, was imprisoned and brought to their chieftain. He spit at me, mocked me and told me to leave this land forever. He doesn't wanted new land and doesn't wanted our land, but he told me that THIS forest was their land and would stay theirs until the ghosts take the last man of his folk!<br> Three weeks later I came back to Fremil to speak with our king. He was furious at the Barbarians, but disallowed an attack of these tribes anyway. He believed, that our army was too weak to resist in a war against the barbarians.<br> I saw no way that I could erase my guilt - without fighting against the Barbarians. So I left Fremil by boat to find a new world and a new life for me somewhere in the south. Now I am sailing on the perl-gulf with my family, some of my friends and a few of my best warriors.\" "
