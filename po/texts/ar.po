"The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to "
"share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended "
"to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure "
"the software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies "
"to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program "
"whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation "
"software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You "
"can apply it to your programs, too.<br>When we speak of free software, we "
"are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are "
"designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free "
"software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source "
"code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use "
"pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these "
"things.<br>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid "
"anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These "
"restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute "
"copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>For example, if you "
"distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must "
"give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must make sure that "
"they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these "
"terms so they know their rights.<br>We protect your rights with two steps: "
"(1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you "
"legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.<br>Also, "
"for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone "
"understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the "
"software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients "
"to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems "
"introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' "
"reputations.<br>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by "
"software patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free "
"program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the "
"program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent "
"must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>The "
"precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification "
"follow.<br>"

"0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice "
"placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms "
"of this General Public License. The Program, below, refers to any such "
"program or work, and a work based on the Program means either the Program or "
"any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing "
"the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or "
"translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included "
"without limitation in the term modification.)  Each licensee is addressed as "
"you.<br>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not "
"covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the "
"Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only "
"if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of "
"having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on "
"what the Program does.<br>"

"as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and "
"appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and "
"disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this "
"License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of "
"the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>You may charge "

"2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, "
"thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such "
"modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you "
"also meet all of these conditions:<br><br>a) You must cause the modified "
"files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the "
"date of any change.<br>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or "
"publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or "
"any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third "
"parties under the terms of this License.<br>c) If the modified program "
"normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when "
"started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print "
"or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a "
"notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a "
"warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these "
"conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.  "

"These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable "
"sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be "
"reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then "
"this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you "
"distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections "
"as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of "
"the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other "
"licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part "
"regardless of who wrote it.<br>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to "
"claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, "
"the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of "
"derivative or collective works based on the Program.<br>In addition, mere "
"aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or "
"with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution "
"medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License."
