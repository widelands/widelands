"Finally! We have just taken our first step towards victory! Last night, we "
"landed on the forbidden island and defeated the few guards that were "
"watching the north-western part of the island. I am quite sure that none of "
"the other warlords has detected us so far, so we should keep quiet and build"
" up our infrastructure. Soon we will be strong enough to raid their "
"positions."
msgstr "În sfârşit! Tocmai am făcut primul pas spre victorie! Aseară, am ajuns pe insula interzisă şi am învins cele câteva gărzi care vegheau partea de nord-vest a insulei. Sunt destul de sigur că nici unul dintre celelalte căpetenii nu ne-au detectat până acum, deci ar trebui să rămânem silenţioşi şi să ne construim infrastructura. În curând vom fi suficient de puternici pentru a le ataca poziţiile"

" still left. We have discovered enemy positions held by Erwyn to the north "
"and east of the castle. He is known to be a strong warlord and surely "
"commands the strongest warriors. In the south, we caught sight of some food "
"infrastructures guarded by Jomo – a younger warlord – and we should take "
