"the other warlords has detected us so far, so we should keep quiet and build"

"It is amazing how far one can see from the highest tower of the castle. We "

"thus did not prepare. Be that as it may, some things will never come to the "
"light of day. The only important issue at the moment are the opposing troops"
" still left. We have discovered enemy positions held by Erwyn to the north "
"and east of the castle. He is known to be a strong warlord and surely "
"commands the strongest warriors. In the south, we caught sight of some food "
"infrastructures guarded by Jomo – a younger warlord – and we should take "
"care of those infrastructures so we can cut off our enemies’ food supply."
