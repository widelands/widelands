"I will do so gladly. Indeed, according to my trade partners Atterdag’s "
"thirst for conquest is limitless. After he has established his presence on "
"Föhr, he has conquered all the other islands in the vicinity as well. Your "
"stronghold on Föhr has always been their only defence to speak of, so once "
"you were gone he seized the entire area with ease."

"The occupants are rumoured to enforce a cruel rule. It is a known fact that "
"they have cut off all trade, and the locals are forced to give half of "
"everything they produce to the Danes in tribute. Half! Already, dozens are "
"said to have been executed for embezzling a bushel of grain. People are "
"suffering, and will no doubt gladly join anyone who comes to free them."

"There is one more thing. Trade ships attempting to sail well north of the "

"Now this is mainly speculation, but I believe that Atterdag transports his "
"troops from the Danish capital to the islands he conquers by ship. The land "
"route is much longer and more strenuous, so it is not hard to see why he "
"would do that. Clearly he attempts to disguise this fact. Why would he do "
"that, unless he believes this secret to be of strategical importance?"

"I do not know how large a part of his soldiers is exchanged between the "
"capital and the islands by ship, but their numbers seem to be large enough "
"that I would advise you to cut this exchange off. As you know, these two "
"areas are connected by only one sea route, and it leads through a strait "
"called the Kattegat. This strait is one a few miles wide and dotted with "
"tiny islands. If you can reach this place without being attacked by their "
"ships, you can seize the islands and build a belt of inconquerable "
"strongholds that block any enemy ship attempting to pass."
