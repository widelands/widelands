"When Chat’Karuth died, he was an old man, father to three strong and "
"ambitious sons and warlord to an army that could match any enemy willing to "
"rise against the ancient forests. Though his glorious reign, Chat’Karuth "
"left his eldest son Thron in the due to succeed him as the tribes warlord – "
"a decision that left his two brothers unsatisfied. The old warlord knew "
"that. As his father told him, Thron left the capital of Al’thunran, the home "
"of the throne among the trees and redrew his forces to the high hills where "
"he buried the corpse of his father and swore to the gods and his spirit, "
"that he’d return to re-established order. While his brothers raged in blind "
"war against Thron and the few forces he left to secure the borders of "
"Al’thunran, the young warlord seeks to reunite his ambitious brothers and "
