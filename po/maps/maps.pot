"Six months ago, Lutius - a young general of the Empire - was sent with 150 soldiers to the frontier beyond the northern forests where Barbarian tribes were crossing onto land held by the Empire. His task was to defend the Empire's land. At first, everything was calm. He even talked to a few barbarian children and thought about a peaceful life - side by side with this archaic folk. He began to feel safer and his army began to drop their attention off the potential enemy. That was their undoing. One night in March his unprepared army was attacked by 100 barbarian footmen and was completely scattered. Only with his bare life he and a handful of his soldiers survived."

Big and old forests, full of big and predatory game, cut across by wetlands and hills were shrouded in mystery. The ones who had managed to come back mentioned tremendous buildings, decorated with carvings and gold from majestic mountain ranges somewhere amongst the wilderness. Dozens of years after only some crumbly ruins remain of these good old times, covered with moss and trees. Their shapes give only an idea about the craftsmanship of ancient constructors. Nobody knows why they (have) disappeared. Nobody knows why. People say that now nothing is blocking the road to wealth. But many will die pulled apart by wolves, engulfed by swamp... encircled by hostile tribes."

"When Chat’Karuth died, he was an old man, father to three strong and ambitious sons and warlord to an army that could match any enemy willing to rise against the ancient forests. Though at the end of his glorious reign, Chat’Karuth left his eldest son, Thron, to succeed him as the tribe's warlord – a decision that left his two brothers unsatisfied. The old warlord knew that. As his father instructed him, Thron left the capital of Al’thunran, the home of the Throne Among the Trees and withdrew his forces to the high hills where he buried the corpse of his father. There he swore to the gods and his father's spirit that he’d return to re-established order. While his brothers raged in blind war against Thron and the few forces he left to secure the borders of Al’thunran, the young warlord seeks to reunite his ambitious brothers and force the tribes to march once again under a common banner."

Onto the last secure place - the highest mountain range where the amount of gold and the space to live merely suffice for one tribe - only two opposite paths lead. But remember, be careful... this last living space is also a hard and small place to live. Don't forget to take care about your timber supplies, you'll need them."
