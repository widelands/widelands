"In this scenario, I’m going to tell you about soldiers, their training and their profession: warfare. Although Widelands is about building up, not burning down, there is an enemy you sometimes have to defeat. Yet warfare is mainly focused on economics, not on military strategies, and its mechanics deserve explanation."

"A new soldier is created like a worker: when a military building needs a soldier, a carrier grabs the needed weapons and armor from a warehouse (or your headquarters) and walks up the road to your new building. Basic Barbarian soldiers do not use armor, they only need an ax."

"Take a look at the soldiers that are on their way to our military buildings. They look different from normal workers: they have a health bar over their head that displays their remaining health, and they have four symbols, which symbolize the individual soldier’s current levels in the four different categories: health, attack, defense and evade."

"If a Barbarian soldier is fully trained, he has level 3 health, level 5 attack, level 0 defense and level 2 evade. This is one fearsome warrior then! The individual abilities have the following meaning:"

"The defense is the percentage that is subtracted from the attack value. The Barbarians cannot train in this skill and therefore have always defense level 0, which means that the damage is always reduced by 3%. If an attacker with an attack value of 35 points hits a Barbarian soldier, the Barbarian will lose 35·0.97 = 34 health."
