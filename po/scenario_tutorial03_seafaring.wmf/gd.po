"Never forget that these rowboats are too small to carry workers. You can use"

"certain no worker will ever have to walk there."
msgstr ""

#: ../../data/campaigns/tutorial03_seafaring.wmf/scripting/texts.lua:311

"And if your waterways present a significant shortcut between your road "
"networks, your economy will tend to send many wares over the waterway. As a "
"waterway can hold only one ferry – unlike roads, which receive a second "
"carrier if they are very busy –, and as they often tend to be rather longer "
"than the two or three fields recommended for roads, there is always a risk "
"of waterways becoming severe bottlenecks in your economy. Try to build "
"several of them in parallel to distribute the strain. If this is not "
"possible, it is in some cases even more efficient not to use waterways."
