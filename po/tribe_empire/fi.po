# TODO: it would be more clear if these sticks were called spears - judging by the "blade" in the heavy lance we are not talking about a jousting lance at all (i.e. what a mounted knight would use), While nowadays lance can be used for any spearlike object, it's originally meant the javelin, which is a sport equipment. Another word for a spear which is used for poking and never throwing is a pike, if we want to make a difference to throwing spears - this is used by infantry, not by mounted knights like lance generally is understood to be.
