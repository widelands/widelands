 * If a player slot is closed, it will not show up here.
 *
 * When passing a \c participant index, the results are ordered: First all human participants
 * are returned, then the AIs.
 * The \c participant indices used by this class are not compatible to other indices,
 * e.g., in GameSettings::players.
 *
 * @note The signal \c participants_updated *must* be triggered by the game if the there are
 *       changes with the participants (e.g., client connects, tribe is selected, ...).
 *       The count of active participants is cached and only recalculated on signal.
