 * 2: Between build 19 and build 20 - Added UUID to allow reconnect with same username after

 * 3: Between build 19 and build 20 - Added network relay for internet games
 * 4: Between build 19 and build 20 - Using CHAP for password authentication
 * 5: Build 20 - Removed obsolete TELL_IP, modifications on user and game listing [supported]
 * 6: Between build 20 and build 21 - Added CHECK_PWD and PWD_OK commands

/**
 * The UUID:

 * The UUID is a semi-permanent ID stored in the configuration file of Widelands.
 * It has to be stored in the file since it should survive crashes of the game or computer.
 * If the game is not started for 24 hours, a new one is created to increase privacy.
 * Basically it allows the metaserver to identify the user even when multiple users try to join with
 * the same username. Note that the sent UUID differs from the stored one: The sent UUID is
 * hash(username | stored-id).
 * In the case of registered players, the password can be used instead of a UUID. The username
 * alone can not be used for this, especially not for unregistered users: The metaserver can not
 * differentiate between a second connection by the user and an initial login of another user
 * (with the same name).
 *
 * Use-cases of the UUID:
 *
 * Reconnect after crash / network problems.
 * When Widelands breaks the connection without logging out, the server still assumes that the old
 * connection is active. So when the player reconnects, another name is chosen. Sending the UUID
 * allows to reclaim the old name, since the server recognizes that there isn't a second player
 * trying to use the same name.
