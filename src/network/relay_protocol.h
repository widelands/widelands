/**
 * Before the internet gaming relay was added, (a) NetHost and (multiple) NetClient established a
 * direct
 * connection and exchanged data packets created and processed by the GameHost/GameClient. With the
 * introduction of the relay this changed: GameHost/GameClient still create and process the data
 * packets.
 * For LAN games, they still pass them to the NetHost/NetClient.
 * For internet games, the traffic is relayed by the wlnr binary in the metaserver repository.
 * GameHost/GameClient pass their packets to the new classes NetHostProxy/NetClientProxy.
 * Those no longer have a direct connection but are both connected to the relay on the metaserver.
 * When they want to exchange messages, they send their packets to the relay which forwards them to
 * the
 * intended recipient.
 * The relay only transport the packets, it does not run any game logic. The idea of this is that
 * the
 * relay runs on an globally reachable computer (i.e. the one of the metaserver) and simplifies
 * connectivity for the users (i.e. no more port forwarding required).
 *
 * Below are the command codes used in the relay protocol. They are used on the connection
 * between NetHostProxy/NetClientProxy and relay.
 *
 * An example of a typical session:
 * 1) A user wants to start an internet game. The Widelands instance tells the metaserver about it.
 * 2) A relay instance is started by the metaserver. On startup of the relay, the nonce of the
 * player is set
 *    as password for the game-host position in the new game. Additionally, the name of the hosted
 * game
 *    is stored. The IP address of the relay is send to the Widelands instance by the metaserver.
 * 3) The Widelands instance of the user connects to the relay.
 * 4) Now there is a reachable relay/game running somewhere. The open game can be listed in the
 * lobby.
 * 5) Clients get the address and port of the relay by the metaserver and can connect to the game.
 *    When enough clients have connected, the GameHost can start the game.
 * 6) When a client wants to send a packet (e.g. user input) to the GameHost, its GameClient packs
 * the packet,
 *    passes it to the local NetClientProxy which sends it to the relay. The relay relays the packet
 * to the
 *    NetHostProxy which passes it to the GameHost.
 * 7) When the GameHost wants to send a packet to one or all clients, it also packs it and passes it
 * to its
 *    NetHostProxy which sends it to the relay, where it is forwarded to the client(s).

 * Transmitting data packets:
 *
 * The main work of the relay consists of passing opaque data packets between GameHost
 * and GameClients. They send SendPacket's over the network and expect to receive RecvPacket's
 * (see network.h). Those packets basically consists of an array of uint8_t with the first two bytes
 * coding the length of the packet.
 * When in the following documentation the \c packet datatype is listed as payload data, such a
 * packet
 * is meant. Since they are already containing their own length, no explicit length field or
 * separator
 * is required to pack them. When sending they are just written out. When receiving, the
 * Deserializer
 * has to read the length first and read the appropriate amount of bytes afterwards.
