 * On Windows we cannot use proper aliases, and using the /EXPORT linker flag
 * is too cumbersome, as it does not work when static linking, and when
 * dynamic linking it does not make the aliases visible within the DLL itself.
 *
 * On macOS we need to use an assembler alias as it does not support
 * the alias attribute.
 *
 * Instead we use normal function wrapper in those cases, which are way more
 * maintainable.
