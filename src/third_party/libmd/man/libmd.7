.Sh NAME
.Nm libmd
.Nd Message Digest functions from BSD systems
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm libmd
library provides message digest functions found on BSD systems either
on their libc or libmd libraries and lacking on others like GNU systems,
thus making it easier to port projects with strong BSD origins, without
needing to embed the same code over and over again on each project.
.Pp
The library provides a compatibility interface for the Aladding Enterprises
MD5 implementation, but the interface is not exposed by default to avoid
polluting the namespace.
The
.Dv LIBMD_MD5_ALADDIN
pre-processor variable needs to be defined to expose this interface.
.Pp
The library provides a
.Xr pkgconf 1
entry named
.Pa libmd .
.Sh HEADERS
The
.Nm libmd
library provides compatibility with various
.Bx
headers and interfaces.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm libmd
project started in the Debian GNU/kFreeBSD port as part of the
.Nm libbsd
library, as a way to ease porting
code from FreeBSD to the GNU-based system.
It was subsequently split into a project created on Hadrons.Org (mirrored
on FreeDesktop.Org) for other distributions and projects to use, and
further extended to match the other BSD interfaces.
.Pp
It is now distributed as part of most non-BSD distributions
