Changes
-------

Eris:
- removed luac.c. It defined a main() function which could hide our own main()
  eris was linked in.

Gettext:
- Renamed the `pgettext` macro to `original_pgettext` to allow encapsulating it in our own `pgettext` macro,
  and added an optional function pointer to `pgettext_aux` to allow our custom logger to hook into `pgettext`.
