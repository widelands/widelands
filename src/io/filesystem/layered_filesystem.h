/**
 * LayeredFileSystem is a file system which basically merges several layered
 * real directory structures into a single one. The really funny thing is that
 * those directories aren't represented as absolute paths, but as nested
 * FileSystems. Are you confused yet?
 * Ultimately, this provides us with the necessary flexibility to allow file
 * overrides on a per-user-basis, nested .zip files acting as Quake-like paks
 * and so on.
 *
 * Only the top-most writable filesystem is written to. A typical
 * stack would look like this in real-life:
 *
 * ~/.widelands/
 * /where/they/installed/widelands/  <-- this is the directory that the
 * executable is in
 *
 * $CWD  <-- the current-working directory; this is useful for debugging, when
 * the executable isn't in the root of the game-data directory
