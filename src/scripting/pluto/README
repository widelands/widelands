This directory contains the stripped down essentials of pluto[1] that we need for
Widelands. You find the complete source and README of pluto on the github repo
from one of it's authors Rob Hoelz at [2]. Our version of pluto has been
heavily modified to create system agnostic files and to work with the widelands
file streaming. The Widelands Team wishes to expresses total and complete
gratitude to the authors of Pluto for making it public domain.
