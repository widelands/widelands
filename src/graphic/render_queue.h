// The RenderQueue is a singleton implementing the concept of deferred
// rendering: Every rendering call that pretends to draw onto the screen will
// instead enqueue an item into the RenderQueue. The Graphic::refresh() will
// then setup OpenGL to render onto the screen and then call
// RenderQueue::draw() which will execute all the draw calls.
//
// The advantage of this design is that render calls can be reordered and
// batched up to avoid OpenGL state changes as much as possible. This can
// reduce the amount of OpenGL calls done in the system per frame by an order
// of magnitude if assets are properly batched up into texture atlases.
//
// Rendering is simple: first everything fully opaque is rendered front to back
// (so that no pixel is drawn twice). This allows for maximum program batching,
// as for example all opaque rectangles can be rendered in one draw call,
// ignoring z-value.
//
// In the second step, all drawing calls with (partially) transparent pixels
// are done. This has to be done strictly in z ordering (back to front), so
// that transparency works correctly. But common operations can still be
// batched - for example the blitting of houses could all be done with the same
// z value and using a common texture atlas. Then they could be drawn in one
// woosh.
//
// Non overlapping rectangles can be drawn in parallel, ignoring z-order. I
// experimented with a linear algorithm to find all overlapping rectangle
// pairs (see bzr history), but it did not buy the performance I was hoping it
// would. So I abandoned this idea again.
//
// Note: all draw calls that target a Texture are not going to the RenderQueue,
// but are still immediately executed. The RenderQueue is only used for
// rendering onto the screen.
//
// TODO(sirver): we could (even) better performance by being z-layer aware
// while drawing. For example the UI could draw non-overlapping windows and
// sibling children with the same z-value for better batching. Also for example
// build-help symbols, buildings, and flags could all be drawn with the same
// z-layer for better batching up. This would also get rid of the z-layer
// issues we are having.
