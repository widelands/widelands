// This is the command queue. It is fully widelands specific,
// it needs to know nearly all modules.
//
// It used to be implemented as a priority_queue sorted by execution_time,
// serial and type of commands. This proved to be a performance bottleneck on
// big games. I then changed this to use a constant size hash_map[gametime] of
// priority_queues. This allows for ~O(1) access by time and in my analyses,
// practically all buckets were used, so there is not much memory overhead.
// This removed the bottleneck for big games.
//
// I first tried with unordered_map, but as expected, it grew beyond all
// limits when accessed with gametime. Therefore I reverted back to a simple
// vector.
//
// The price we pay is that when saving, we also have to traverse till we no
// longer find any new command to write. This could theoretically take forever
// but in my tests it was not noticeable.
