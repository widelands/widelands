/**
 * Bobs are moving map objects: Animals, humans, ships...
 *
 * The name comes from original Settlers2 terminology.
 *
 * \par Bobs, Tasks and their signalling
 *
 * Bobs have a call-stack of "tasks". The top-most \ref Task is the one that is
 * currently being executed.
 *
 * Upon initialization, an object has no Task at all. A CMD_ACT will be
 * scheduled automatically. When it is executed, \ref init_auto_task() is
 * called to automatically select a fallback Task.
 *
 * However, the creator of the Bob can choose to push a specific Task
 * immediately after creating the Bob. This will override the fallback
 * behaviour. init_auto_task() is also called when the final task is popped
 * from the stack.
 *
 * All state information that a Task uses must be stored in the State structure
 * returned by get_state(). Every Task on the Task stack has its own
 * State structure, i.e. push_task() does not destroy the current Task's State.
 *
 * In order to start a new sub-task, you have to call \ref push_task(), and then
 * fill the State structure returned by get_state() with any parameters that the
 * Task may need.
 *
 * A Task is ended by \ref pop_task(). Note, however, that pop_task() can only
 * be called from a Task's update() function. If you want to interrupt the
 * current \ref Task for some reason, you should call \ref send_signal().
 * The signal semantics are explained below in more detail.
 *
 * To implement a new Task, you need to create a new Task object with an
 * update() function. This update() function is called in one of the following
 * situations:
 * \li a timeout set by \ref schedule_act() has occurred
 * \li the task has just been started via \ref push_task()
 * \li the child task has ended via \ref pop_task()
 * \li a signal has been sent via \ref send_signal()
 * It is the responsibility of the update() function to distinguish between
 * these situations as appropriate.
 *
 * One of the following things must happen during update():
 * \li Call schedule_act() to schedule the next call to update()
 * \li Call skip_act() if you really don't want to act until a signal occurs.
 * \li Call pop_task() to end the current task
 * \li Send a new signal via \ref send_signal(). Note that in this case,
 *     the update() function will be called again after some delay, and it
 *     remains the responsibility of the update() function to deal with the
 *     signal.
 * The last case is mostly useful when signals are sent from functions that
 * can be called at any time, such as \ref set_location().
 *
 * Whenever \ref send_signal() is called, any current signal is overwritten
 * by the new signal and the signal_immediate() functions of all Tasks on the
 * stack are called if available. Note that these functions are not supposed
 * to perform any actions besides bookkeeping actions that must be performed
 * in all situations (for example, one might zero some pointer in
 * signal_immediate() to avoid dangling pointers).
 *
 * Then, \ref send_signal() schedules a future call to the top-most task's
 * update() function. Often, update() functions will just call \ref pop_task()
 * and leave the signal handling to their parent tasks. To ultimately handle
 * a signal, the update() function must call \ref signal_handled().
 *
 * If a task maintains state outside of its \ref State structure, it may have
 * to do certain bookkeeping tasks whenever the task is popped from the stack.
 * To this end, a task may have a \ref Task::pop method. If this method
 * exists, it is always called just before the task is popped from the stack.
