ConstructionSite
----------------
A "building" that acts as a placeholder during construction work.
Once the construction phase is finished, the ConstructionSite is removed
and replaced by the actual building.

A construction site can have a worker.
A construction site has one (or more) input wares types, each with an
  associated store.

Note that the ConstructionSiteDescr class is mostly a dummy class.
The ConstructionSite is derived from Building so that it fits in more cleanly
with the transport and Flag code.

Every tribe has exactly one ConstructionSiteDescr.
The ConstructionSite's idling animation is the basic construction site marker.
