/** The WorkareaInfo stores radii and for each radius a set of strings.
 *
 * A Workarea is a "circle" around a building that this building affects
 * or is needed by this buildingr., e.g. Areas for Mines, Fields of a Farm.
 * Worareas are shown on the Map when clicking on or placing a building.
 *
 * Each string contains a description of an activity (or similar)
 * that can be performed within the radius. Examples are buldings
 * that can be upgraded like a Fortress, and will have a bigger
 * workarea then.
