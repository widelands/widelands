DismantleSite
-------------
The dismantlesite is a way to get some resources back when destroying buildings.
It has a builder as worker and will show the idle image of the original
building which gets smaller and smaller.

Every tribe has exactly one DismantleSite_Descr.
The DismantleSite_Descr's idling animation is remaining graphic that is shown under
the destructed building.
