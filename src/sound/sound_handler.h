/** The 'sound server' for Widelands.
 *
 * SoundHandler collects all functions for dealing with music and sound effects
 * in one class. It is similar in task - though not in scope - to well known
 * sound servers like gstreamer, EsounD or aRts. For the moment (and probably
 * forever), the only backend supported is SDL_mixer.
 *
 * \par Music
 *
 * Background music for different situations (e.g. 'Menu', 'Gameplay') is
 * collected in songsets. Each Songset contains references to one or more
 * songs in ogg format. The only ordering inside a soundset is from the order
 * in which the songs were loaded.
 *
 * Other classes can request to start or stop playing a certain songset,
 * changing the songset is provided as a convenience method. It is also
 * possible to switch to some other piece inside the same songset - but there
 * is \e no control over \e which song out of a songset gets played. The
 * selection is either linear (the order in which the songs were loaded) or
 * completely random.
 *
 * The files for the predefined system songsets
 * \li \c intro
 * \li \c menu
 * \li \c ingame
 *
 * must reside directly in the directory 'sounds' and must be named
 * SONGSET_XX.??? where XX is a number from 00 to 99 and ??? is a filename
 * extension. All subdirectories of 'sounds' will be considered to contain
 * ingame music. The the music and sub-subdirectories found in them can be
 * arbitrarily named. This means: everything below sound/ingame_01 can have
 * any name you want. All audio files below sound/ingame_01 will be played as
 * ingame music.
 *
 * For more information about the naming scheme, see load_fx()
 *
 * You should be using the ogg format for music.
 *
 * \par Sound effects
 *
 * Buildings and workers can use sound effects in their programs. To do so, use
 * e.g. "playsound blacksmith_hammer" in the appropriate conf file. The conf file
 * parser will then load one or more audio files for 'hammering blacksmith'
 * from the building's/worker's configuration directory and store them in an
 * FXset for later access, similar to the way music is stored in songsets.
 * For effects, however, the selection is always random. Sound effects are kept
 * in memory at all times, to avoid delays from disk access.
 *
 * The abovementioned sound effects are synchronized with a work program. It's
 * also possible to have sound effects that are synchronized with a
 * building/worker \e animation. For more information about this look at class
 * AnimationManager.
 *
 * \par Usage of callbacks
 *
 * SDL_mixer's way to notify the application of important sound events, e.g.
 * that a song is finished, are callbacks. While callbacks in and of themselves
 * are a fine thing, they can also be a pain in the body part with which we
 * usually touch our chairs.
 *
 * Problem 1:
 *
 * Callbacks must use global(or static) functions \e but \e not normal member
 * functions of a class. If you must know why: ask google. But how can a
 * static function share data with an instance of it's own class? Usually not at
 * all.
 *
 * Fortunately, g_sound_handler already is a global variable,
 * and therefore accessible to global functions. So problem 1 disappears.
 *
 * Problem 2:
 *
 * Callbacks run in the caller's context. This means that when
 * music_finished_callback() is called, SDL_mixer and SDL_audio <b>will
 * be holding all of their locks!!</b> "So what?", you ask. The above means
 * that one \e must \e not call \b any SDL_mixer functions from inside the
 * callback, otherwise a deadlock is guaranteed. This indirectly does include
 * start_music(), stop_music() and of course change_music().
 * Unfortunately, that's just the functions we'd need to execute from the
 * callback. As if that was not enough, SDL_mixer internally uses
 * two separate threads, so you \e really don't want to play around with
 * locking.
 *
 * The only way around that resctriction is to send an SDL event(SDL_USEREVENT)
 * from the callback (non-sound SDL functions \e can be used). Then, later,
 * the main event loop will process this event \e but \e not in
 * SDL_mixer's context, so locking is no problem.
 *
 * Yes, that's just a tad ugly.
 *
 * No, there's no other way. At least none that I found.
 *
 * \par Stopping music without blocking
 *
 * When playing background music with SDL_mixer, we can fade the audio in/out.
 * Unfortunately, Mix_FadeOutMusic() will return immediately - but, as the music
 * is not yet stopped, starting a new piece of background music will block. So
 * the choice is to block (directly) after ordering to fade out or indirectly
 * when starting the next piece. Now imagine a fadeout-time of 30 seconds ...
 * and the user who is waiting for the next screen ......
 *
 * The solution is to work asynchronously, which is doable, as we already use a
 * callback to tell us when the audio is \e completely finished. So in
 * stop_music() (or change_music()) we just start the fadeout. The
 * callback then tells us when the audio has actually stopped and we can start
 * the next music. To differentiate between the two states we can just take a
 * peek with Mix_MusicPlaying() if there is music running. To make sure that
 * nothing bad happens, that check is not only required in change_music()
 * but also in start_music(), which causes the seemingly recursive call to
 * change_music() from inside start_music(). It really is not recursive, trust
 * me :-)
