/**
 * The PortDock occupies the fields in the water at which ships
 * dock at a port. As such, this class cooperates closely with
 * @ref Warehouse to implement the port functionality.
 *
 * @ref WareInstance and @ref Worker that are waiting to be
 * transported by ship are stored in the PortDock instead of
 * the associated @ref WareHouse.
 *
 * @paragraph PortDockLifetime
 *
 * The PortDock is created and removed by its owning warehouse.
 * Throughout the life of the PortDock, the corresponding @ref Warehouse
 * instance exists.
 *
 * @paragraph Limitations
 *
 * Currently, there is a 1:1 relationship between @ref Warehouse
 * and PortDock. In principle, it would be conceivable to have a
 * port that is on a land bridge and therefore close to two
 * disconnected bodies of water. Such a port would have to have
 * two PortDock that belong to the same @ref Warehouse, but have
 * separate @ref ShipFleet instances.
 * However, we expect this to be such a rare case that it is not
 * implemented at the moment.
