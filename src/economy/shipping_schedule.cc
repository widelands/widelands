	 * This function is the heart of the shipping system.
	 * All decisions (except emergency decisions on port destruction) are made here.
	 * Here, we decide which ship will when arrive at which port and how many items
	 * for which destinations it will pick up.
	 * When we were notified that a ship or port was added or lost, we do some
	 * maintenance around this fact in other functions, but our main job is to check
	 * on every call every single port whether it has wares that will not be
	 * transported anytime soon. If so, we can tell a nearby idle ship to pick up
	 * wares, or order a ship that is already heading there to pick them up (if it
	 * makes sense), or leave them for now for lack of capacity.
	 * Additionally, we will distribute idle ships more or less equally among ports
	 * so that every port will have a ship at hand immediately when it requires one
	 * (provided that we have enough ships, of course).
	 * In theory, it would be good to implement intelligent reordering of ships'
	 * destinations, so as to avoid routes like A-B-C where A and C are close and B
	 * is far away. We used to have such an algorithm, but it was shown to
	 * necessarily be a performance killer (I only say Travelling Salesman Problem),
	 * so we dropped support for this approach and instead prefer the GOLDEN RULE that
	 * a ship should never service too many destinations at once, regardless of their
	 * relative distances. One ship from B to A plus one ship from B to C are better
	 * than one ship from B to both A and C. Instead we prefer to distribute tasks
	 * among many ships. This produces the best results when the player builds a large
	 * naval force. (When the player has few ships for many ports, this approach will
	 * work suboptimally, but that is a bad strategy so the player deserves no more.)
