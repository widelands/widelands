/**
 * This helper facilitates semi-custom A-star type routing over
 * the @ref RoutingNode (i.e. @ref Flag) network of an eocnomy.
 *
 * The template is parameterized by an @em estimator. The estimator
 * is a functor that takes a reference to a @ref RoutingNode and
 * returns a cost estimate for the remaining distance.
 * As usual for A-star, the shortest path is only guaranteed to be
 * found if the estimator always returns an under-estimate.
 *
 * Typical usage is something like the following:
 * @code
 * RouteAStar<Estimator> astar(router, wwWARE, estimator);
 * astar.push(startnode);
 *
 * while (RoutingNode * current = astar.step()) {
 *   if (current == &destnode) {
 *     astar.routeto(current, route);
 *     break;
 *   }
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @warning It is currently impossible to have two RouteAStar instances
 * running concurrently.
 *
 * The closedset of A* is emulated by giving each node a field that indicates when it was
 * last touched in routing (mpf_cycle). The router itself also has such a field,
 * which is increased for each run of the algorithm, see @ref Router::assign_cycle.
 *
 * @see MapAStar
