Trackable must be the base class of any class that is used in

for every Trackable. It contains a pointer to the Trackable and it keeps
track of how many TrackPtrs are referencing it.
The Trackable destructor notifies the Tracker of its destruction, but it will
not delete the Tracker itself: the Tracker will stick around until it is no
longer referenced by any TrackPtrs.
