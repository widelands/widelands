 * Calculate a route between two nodes.

 * specified and no cheap route could be found.
 *
 * \note route will be init()ed before storing the result.
 *
 * \param start, end start and endpoint of the route
 * \param route the calculated route, can be 0 to only check connectivity
 * \param type whether the route is being calculated for a ware or a worker;
 *        this affects the cost calculations
 * \param cost_cutoff if non-negative: maximum cost for desirable routes.
 *        If no route cheaper than this can be found, return false.
 *        Set this parameter to -1 to allow arbitrarily large routes.
