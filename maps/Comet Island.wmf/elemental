descr=_"A few miles in front of Gerion Coast lies a small unnamed island. Until now, you have not seen any reason, to ship there, but yesterday a big fireball came from the sky and touched down in it's middle. Is this a sign of the Gods? You believe it is and you hope, that your tribe will find the treasure of this island, before other tribes will follow."
