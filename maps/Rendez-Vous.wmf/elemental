descr=""Only a small hill in the "
       "centre of the map "
       "connects these four "
       "competing tribes. "
       "Lead your army right "
       "away to this hill and "
       "build a giant "
       "stronghold as a sign of "
       "your superiority! Hint: "
       "In the centre is only "
       "space for one "
       "stronghold. Water can "
       "be found everywhere, "
       "so there is no need to "
       "send out geologists.""
