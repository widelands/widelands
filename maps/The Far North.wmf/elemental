descr=_ "Some say that impenetrable lands to the far north scared away even the most courageous settlers and the bravest of the brave warriors. Big and old forests, full of big and predatory game, cut across by wetlands and hills were shrouded in mystery. The ones who had managed to come back mentioned tremendous buildings, decorated with carvings and gold from majestic mountain ranges somewhere amongst the wilderness. Dozens of years after only some crumbly ruins remain of these good old times, covered with moss and trees. Their shapes give only an idea about the craftsmanship of ancient constructors. Nobody knows why they (have) disappeared. Nobody knows why. People say that now nothing is blocking the road to wealth. But many will die pulled apart by wolves, engulfed by swamp... encircled by hostile tribes."
