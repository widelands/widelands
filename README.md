Widelands is a free, open source real-time strategy game with singleplayer campaigns and a multiplayer mode.
The game was inspired by Settlers II™ (© Bluebyte) but has significantly more variety and depth to it.

## Download

On how to download Widelands, see https://www.widelands.org/wiki/Download/

## Compiling

We support compiling Widelands for Linux, Windows under MSys2 and MSVC, and MacOS with GCC >= 7 or Clang/LLVM >= 7, though it might work with other compilers too. We have more detailed documentation available at: https://www.widelands.org/wiki/BuildingWidelands/


### Dependencies

You will need to install the following dependencies:

*  [libSDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) >=2.0
*  [libSDL_image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image)
*  [libSDL_mixer](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer) >= 2.0
*  [libSDL_ttf](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf) >= 2.0
*  [gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html)
* libiconv (on same mirrors as gettext)
*  [zlib](https://www.zlib.net/)

*  [libglew](http://glew.sourceforge.net) or [glbinding](https://glbinding.org/)


### Compiling with our convenience script

You can then compile by running our convenience script.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `./compile.sh` | Full debug build |
| `./compile.sh -r -w` | Release build |
| `./compile.sh -h` | List available options |

When compiling has finished, you can call Widelands with

~~~~
./widelands
~~~~

### Compiling with CMake

You can also call CMake manually:

~~~~
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
~~~~

When compiling has finished, you can call Widelands with

~~~~
cd ..
mv build/src/widelands .
./widelands
~~~~

We have various CMake options available. For example, to create a release build, call

~~~~
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
~~~~

For using the Ninja build system, call

~~~~
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G Ninja ..
ninja
~~~~

Depending on the Ninja installation, the last line can also be `ninja-build`.

#### CMake options

Note that CMake options are prefixed with `-D`. These are the available options:

| Name | Values | Default| Function
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` | `Debug`/`Release` | `Debug` | Create a release or debug build |
| `OPTION_ASAN` | `ON`/`OFF` | `ON` for Debug builds /`OFF` for Release builds | Use AddressSanitizer. Switching this off only works once. You will have to clear the `build` directory if you want to switch this off again in a later build. |
| `OPTION_BUILD_TRANSLATIONS` | `ON`/`OFF` | `ON` | Build translations |
| `OPTION_BUILD_CODECHECK` | `ON`/`OFF` | `ON` | Build codecheck. Only available in Debug builds. |
| `OPTION_BUILD_WEBSITE_TOOLS` | `ON`/`OFF` | `ON` | Build website-related tools |
| `OPTION_BUILD_TESTS` | `ON`/`OFF` | `ON` | Build unit tests |
| `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` | A directory | See [CMake documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.html) | Define the target directory for the "install" target, e.g. `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/widelands-install`. |
| `WL_INSTALL_BINDIR` | A directory | `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/games` | Define the destination of executables files (if installing) |
| `WL_VERSION` | A version string | Autodetected from git/bzr, or set by adding a `VERSION` file | Define the Widelands version |
| `USE_XDG` | `ON`/`OFF` | `ON` | Follow XDG-Basedir specification. Only available on Linux. |
| `OPTION_USE_GLBINDING` | `ON`/`OFF` | `OFF` | Use glbinding instead of GLEW |
| `OPTION_GLEW_STATIC` | `ON`/`OFF` | `OFF` | Use static GLEW Library |
| `OPTION_FORCE_EMBEDDED_MINIZIP` | `ON`/`OFF` | `OFF` | Used embedded minizip sources (skip checking for installed minizip library) |

#### make/ninja targets

You can add targets to the `make` or `ninja` command, e.g. `make lang` to build only the translations. These are the available targets:

| Name | Function |
| --- | --- |
| `ALL` or no target | Compile everything, up to executable with the settings from the `cmake` call |
| `codecheck` | Run the codechecks |
| `doc` | Generate Doxygen documentation. Currently only with Build Type Debug, but this is easily changed if necessary. |
| `install` | Install into the target dir, this is `/usr/local` per default (you need root privileges!) unless you change it (see CMake options above) |
| `lang` | Generate the translations |

## Contributing

We have some instructions on how to use Git to help you if you're new to Git: https://www.widelands.org/wiki/GitPrimer/

### Code

The master branch and all issues and pull requests are mirrored bidirectionally between our developer environments on Codeberg and GitHub by bunnybot. Bunnybot also formats the code (C++, Lua, and Python) in all mirrored branches.

We follow the [Google Styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Obtaining MacOS and MS-Windows builds and testsuite runs

All pushes to master will be built on AppVeyor. Pull request branches are deployed for MS-Windows using a GitHub action. To obtain MS-Windows builds if you do not wish to open a pull request, temporarily add the name of your branch to the `branches` section in `appveyor.yml`. This will not work if the branch is in a fork though.

All pull request branches as well as master are additionally deployed for MacOS, and a testsuite checks them under various compilers. To obtain MacOS builds or testsuite results, temporarily add the name of your branch to the `branches` section in `.github/workflows/build.yaml`. This *does* work for branches in forks as well.
