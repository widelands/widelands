1. FONTLOG for Widelands
========================
This file provides detailed information on the Widelands font software.
This information should be distributed along with the Widelands fonts and
any derivative works.


2. Basic Font Information
=========================
The developement of the Widelands font was first started to create a logo for
the Widelands-project, which develops a free, GPLed, realtime strategy game,
similiar to BlueBytes Settler2(c). Nowadays the font gets more and more complete
and should give the possibility to create imperial, fantasy and/or decorative
logos, headings and other texts.

The font is not created to be used in normal texts, as it is too complex and not
that easy to read as a simple sans serif font. Anyway, you are free to use it
for anything you want, as long as allowed by the Open Font License (take a look
at the file "LICENSE" for more information).
