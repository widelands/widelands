name: Formatting your code
on:
  # We are interested only in master and PRs, but GitHub explicitly forbids
  # pushing to the fork when an event is triggered on the base repo.
  # We therefore need to intercept all calls and filter out the ones we are
  # interested in.
  # For master, and branches with an open PR, we run utils/fix_formatting.py.
  # We then commit and push the changes to the branch.
  # If someone pushes to the branch while we're still formatting,
  # we exit 1 instead of pushing.
  # For other branches without an open PR, we also run fix_formatting.py, but
  # we do not push anything, only signal the code quality by exiting 0 or 1.
