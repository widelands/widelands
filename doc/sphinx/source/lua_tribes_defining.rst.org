Defining Tribes
===============

Each tribe is bootstrapped with the following scripts:

* ``data/tribes/initialization/<tribe_name>/init.lua``: Provides basic information about a
  tribe to the game launching screens. The player won't be able to select a
  tribe without it being defined in such a file.
* ``data/tribes/initialization/<tribe_name>/units.lua``: These scripts tell the engine which units
  belong to each tribe. They also define some global animated images for each
  tribe (flags, borders, roads).
* ``data/tribes/initialization/<tribe_name>/starting_conditions``: Contains a subdirectory with
  the game starting conditions available for a tribe. These scripts need to
  be listed in ``data/tribes/initialization/<tribe_name>/init.lua`` in order for Widelands to find them.


The tribe objects are then defined by the following scripts:

* ``data/tribes/<path>/init.lua``: This file defines the map objects to load
  from its path.
* ``data/tribes/<path>/register.lua``: This file has to list the names of all
  objects defined in the path's ``init.lua`` file. Only tribe objects that are
  listed in these files will be registered for loading, and the names must match
  with the respective ``init.lua`` file. Attributes are also defined here.
* See :ref:`defining_tribe_units` for further details.
