Defining Units
==============

A tribe can have the following types of units: buildings (militarysites,
partially_finished, productionsites, trainingsites and warehouses; headquarters
are a special case of warehouse), immovables, workers, wares, and a ship.

The definitions for the tribes' units are located in the subdirectories of
``data/tribes``. Each unit needs to have an ``init.lua`` and a ``helptexts.lua``
file. The ``init.lua`` script will load the unit to be used in the game, and
``helptexts.lua`` will provide the information used by the in-game help
('Tribal Encyclopedia') and by our website's online
`Encyclopedia <https://wl.widelands.org/encyclopedia/>`_.
