Defining Units
==============

A tribe can have the following types of units: buildings (militarysites,
partially_finished, productionsites, trainingsites and warehouses; headquarters
are a special case of warehouse), immovables, workers, wares, and a ship.

The definitions for the tribes' units are located in the subdirectories of
``data/tribes``. Each subdirectory needs to have a ``register.lua``, an ``init.lua`` and a ``helptexts.lua``
file.

* ``register.lua`` will inform the engine about the existence of units and their attributes if they have any.
  This is needed for registering the objects before they are loaded.
* ``init.lua`` will load the units if they are used in the game
* ``helptexts.lua`` will provide the information used by the in-game help
  ('Tribal Encyclopedia') and by our website's online
  `Encyclopedia <https://wlww.widelands.org/encyclopedia/>`_.

Example for ``init.lua``:

.. code-block:: lua

   tribes:new_immovable_type {
      name = "berry_bush_blueberry_tiny",
      ...
   }

   tribes:new_immovable_type {
      name = "berry_bush_blueberry_small",
      ...
   }

   tribes:new_immovable_type {
      name = "berry_bush_blueberry_medium",
      ...
   }

   tribes:new_immovable_type {
      name = "berry_bush_blueberry_ripe",
      ...
   }

The matching ``register.lua`` would look like this:

.. code-block:: lua

   return {
      berry_bush_blueberry_tiny = { "seed_berrybush" },
      berry_bush_blueberry_small = {},
      berry_bush_blueberry_medium = { "flowering" },
      berry_bush_blueberry_ripe = { "ripe_bush" },
   }

.. note: If you are defining multiple unit types that can be enhanced or that will
   transform into each other in the same ``init.lua``, the enhanced/transformed type
   needs to be listed first.
   Also, ``berry_bush_blueberry_small`` in this example has no attributes, so its
   attribute table is empty.

Available unit types:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 3

   autogen_toc_lua_tribes_buildings
   autogen_toc_lua_tribes_workers
