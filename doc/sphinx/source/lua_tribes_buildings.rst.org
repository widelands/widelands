Buildings
=========

Buildings are defined in their ``init.lua`` file. They also have a corresponding ``helptexts.lua`` file that contains their help texts.

Types of Buildings

Common Building Properties
--------------------------

Buildings are defined with Lua functions called ``new_<building_type>_type{table}``. The contents of ``table`` depend on the type of building that you are defining. The common properties shared by all buildings are:


**msgctxt**
    *Mandatory*. The context that Gettext will use to disambiguate the translations for
    strings in this table, e.g.::

        msgctxt = "atlanteans_building",

**name**
    *Mandatory*. A string containing the internal name of this building, e.g.::

        name = "atlanteans_fortress",

**descname**
    *Mandatory*. The translatable display name. Use ``pgettext`` with the ``msgctxt``
    above to fetch the string, e.g.::

        descname = pgettext("atlanteans_building", "Fortress"),

**helptext_script**
    *Mandatory*. The full path to the ``helptexts.lua`` script for this building.

**icon**
    *Mandatory*. The full path to the menu icon for this building.

**representative_image**
    *Optional*. The full path to a representative image for this building.
    This is needed if the building has a scaled "idle" animation.

**size**
    *Mandatory*. The size of this building: ``"small"``, ``"medium"``, or ``"big"``.

**vision_range**
    *Optional. Default:* ``0``. The size of the radius that the building sees.

**buildcost**
    *Optional*. A table with the wares used to build this building, containing
    warename - amount pairs, e.g.::

        buildcost = { log = 4, granite = 2 }

    When ``buildcost`` is defined, you also need to define ``return_on_dismantle``.

**return_on_dismantle**
    *Optional*. The wares that this building will give back to the player when it is
    dismantled, e.g.::

        buildcost = { log = 2, granite = 1 }

**enhancement**
    *Optional*. The name of a building that this building can be enhanced to, e.g.::

        enhancement = "atlanteans_fancy_building",

    If ``enhancement`` is defined, the building that this building enhances
    to will need to define ``enhancement_cost`` and
    ``return_on_dismantle_on_enhanced``.

**enhancement_cost**
    *Optional*. The wares needed to upgrade this building, e.g.::

        enhancement_cost = { log = 1, granite = 1 }

**return_on_dismantle_on_enhanced**
    *Optional*. The wares that this enhanced building will give back to the player
    when it is dismantled, e.g.::

        return_on_dismantle_on_enhanced = { granite = 1 }

**animation_directory**
    *Mandatory*. The location of the animation png files.

**animations**
    *Mandatory*. A table containing all animations for this building. Every building
    needs to have an ``idle`` animation. Other animations that a building
    can have are ``build``, ``working``, ``unoccupied``. Mines also have
    an ``unoccupied`` animation.
    See :doc:`animations` for a detailed description of the animation format.

**needs_seafaring**
    *Optional. Default:* ``false``. Set to ``true`` if this building will only be available on seafaring maps.

**aihints**
    *Mandatory*. A list of name - value pairs with hints for the AI. Can be empty.

Help Texts
----------

Each building has a ``helptexts.lua`` script, which is located in the same directory as its ``init.lua`` script.
The functions in this file return texts that are used for buildings by the Tribal Encyclopedia.

See also the helper functions in :ref:`lua_tribes_global_helptexts.lua`.


.. function:: building_helptext_lore()

   Returns a localized string with a lore helptext for this building.
   If you don't have a lore text yet, use ``no_lore_text_yet()`` from the ``lua_tribes_global_helptexts.lua`` script.


.. function:: building_helptext_lore_author()

   Returns a localized string with a fictional author for the lore helptext for this building. The returned string can be empty.
   If you don't have an author yet, use ``no_lore_author_text_yet()`` from the :ref:`lua_tribes_global_helptexts.lua` script.

   :returns: Localized lore text


.. function:: building_helptext_purpose()

   Returns a localized string with a purpose helptext for this building. This should be individually defined for all buildings. You can use ``no_purpose_text_yet()`` from the :ref:`lua_tribes_global_helptexts.lua` script if you're not ready to define this yet.

   :returns: Localized purpose text


.. function:: building_helptext_note()

   Returns a localized string with a note that is added to the purpose. This can be empty.

   :returns: Localized note text or empty string.


.. function:: building_helptext_performance()

   Returns a localized string with a performance helptext for this building. You can use ``no_purpose_text_yet()`` from the :ref:`lua_tribes_global_helptexts.lua` script if the performance hasn't been calculated yet. Leave empty when this isn't applicable (e.g. for militarysites or warehouses).

   :returns: Localized performance text or empty string.
