Buildings
=========

Buildings are defined in their ``init.lua`` file. They also have a corresponding ``helptexts.lua`` file that contains their help texts.

Types of Buildings

Widelands knows about the following types of buildings:

Common Building Properties
--------------------------

Buildings are defined with Lua functions called ``new_<building_type>_type{table}``. The contents of ``table`` depend on the type of building that you are defining. The common properties shared by all buildings are:

**name**
    *Mandatory*. A string containing the internal name of this building, e.g.::

        name = "atlanteans_fortress",

**descname**
    *Mandatory*. The translatable display name. Use ``pgettext`` to fetch the string, e.g.::

        descname = pgettext("atlanteans_building", "Fortress"),

**helptext_script**
    *Mandatory*. The full path to the ``helptexts.lua`` script for this building.

**icon**
    *Mandatory*. The full path to the menu icon for this building.

**representative_image**
    *Optional*. The full path to a representative image for this building.
    This is needed if the building has a scaled "idle" animation.

**size**
    *Mandatory*. The size of this building: ``"small"``, ``"medium"``, or ``"big"``.

**vision_range**
    *Optional. Default:* ``0``. The size of the radius that the building sees.

**buildcost**
    *Optional*. A table with the wares used to build this building, containing
    warename - amount pairs, e.g.::

        buildcost = { log = 4, granite = 2 }

    When ``buildcost`` is defined, you also need to define ``return_on_dismantle``.

**return_on_dismantle**
    *Optional*. The wares that this building will give back to the player when it is
    dismantled, e.g.::

        buildcost = { log = 2, granite = 1 }

**enhancement**
    *Optional*. The name of a building that this building can be enhanced to, e.g.::

        enhancement = "atlanteans_fancy_building",

    If ``enhancement`` is defined, the building that this building enhances
    to will need to define ``enhancement_cost`` and
    ``return_on_dismantle_on_enhanced``.

**enhancement_cost**
    *Optional*. The wares needed to upgrade this building, e.g.::

        enhancement_cost = { log = 1, granite = 1 }

**return_on_dismantle_on_enhanced**
    *Optional*. The wares that this enhanced building will give back to the player
    when it is dismantled, e.g.::

        return_on_dismantle_on_enhanced = { granite = 1 }

**animation_directory**
    *Mandatory*. The location of the animation png files.

**animations**
    *Mandatory*. A table containing all animations for this building. Every building
    needs to have an ``idle`` animation. Other animations that a building
    can have are ``build``, ``working``, ``unoccupied``. Mines also have
    an ``unoccupied`` animation.
    See :doc:`animations` for a detailed description of the animation format.

**needs_seafaring**
    *Optional. Default:* ``false``. Set to ``true`` if this building will only be available on seafaring maps.

**aihints**
    *Mandatory*. A list of name - value pairs with hints for the AI. Can be empty.

For making the UI texts translateable, we also need to push/pop the correct textdomain.

Example:

.. code-block:: lua

    push_textdomain("tribes")

    dirname = path.dirname (__file__)

    tribes:new_warehouse_type {
       name = "frisians_headquarters",
       -- TRANSLATORS: This is a building name used in lists of buildings
       descname = pgettext("frisians_building", "Headquarters"),
       icon = dirname .. "menu.png",
       size = "big",
       destructible = false,

       spritesheets = {
          idle = {
             directory = dirname,
             basename = "idle",
             hotspot = {92, 102},
             frames = 10,
             columns = 5,
             rows = 2,
             fps = 10
          }
       },

       aihints = {},

       heal_per_second = 220,
       conquers = 9,
    }

    pop_textdomain()


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
