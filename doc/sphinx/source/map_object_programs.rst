Programs
========

Some map object will have special programs that define their behavior.
You can describe these programs in their ``init.lua`` files, in the ``programs``
table. Map objects that can have programs are:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 3

   Production Sites <productionsite_program>
   Workers <autogen_tribes_worker_programs>
   Immovables <immovable_program>
