Themes
======

A theme defines the appearance and style of :doc:`Widelands' user interface <autogen_wl_ui>`.
Especially some widgets defined with :meth:`~wl.ui.Panel.create_child` need some of the
styles of themes.

When working with :doc:`richtext <autogen_auxiliary_richtext>` it is recommended to use the
theme styles. Look at :doc:`autogen_styles` to access the styles within richtext.

A theme's directory needs to use the following directory structure:

* base_directory/
    * init.lua
    * wui/
        * button.png
        * windows/
            * background.png
            * bottom.png
            * close.png
            * left.png
            * maximize.png
            * minimize.png
            * pin.png
            * right.png
            * top.png
            * unpin.png
    * fsmenu/
        * button.png
        * windows/
            * background.png
            * bottom.png
            * close.png
            * left.png
            * maximize.png
            * minimize.png
            * pin.png
            * right.png
            * top.png
            * unpin.png
    * loadscreens/
        * logo.png
        * gametips.png
        * ending.png
        * splash.jpg
        * editor.png
        * mainmenu/
            * image1.png
            * image2.jpg
            * ...
        * gameloading/
            * desert/
                * image1.png
                * image2.jpg
                * ...
            * summer/
                * image1.png
                * ...
            * wasteland/
                * image1.png
                * ...
            * winter/
                * image1.png
                * ...
    * images/
        * ...

The names of all files and directories in ``loadscreens`` as well as the names ``wui/`` and ``fsmenu``
are hardcoded, except for the names and amounts of the image files in ``loadscreens/mainmenu`` and
in the subdirectories of ``loadscreens/gameloading/``. These directories may contain any number of
images. Supported image formats are JPG (large, photographic pictures) and PNG (all other images).

Required Files
--------------

**loadscreens/logo.png**
    Will be used for the large 'Widelands' logo banner displayed in the main menu.

**loadscreens/gametips.png**
    Will be used as background for the tips shown while starting or loading a game.

**loadscreens/ending.png**
    Will be tiled across the screen during a lengthy operation to indicate that user input is blocked.
    Introduced in version 1.1.

**loadscreens/splash.png**
    The splash screen shown when starting Widelands.

**loadscreens/editor.png**
    The splash screen shown when starting the map editor.

**loadscreens/mainmenu/**
    Any number of images that will be used as backgrounds for the main menu. If more than one
    image is present, they will be exchanged in frequent intervals. If no images are found,
    the splashscreen will be used as background instead.

**loadscreens/gameloading/**
    Contains one subdirectory for each of the four map themes 'desert', 'summer', 'wasteland', and
    'winter'. Each of these directories may contain any number of images. Whenever a map is loaded,
    a random image from the subdirectory corresponding to the map's theme will be used as
    background image for the loading screen. If a theme contains no images, the Widelands logo
    will be used as background instead.

If any of the above images or directories is missing, a fallback image will be used.

**wui/** and **fsmenu/**
    These directories contain images for UI elements for items in the game and editor ('wui') and
    in the main menu ('fsmenu'). The filenames and -paths may be changed, though the correct paths
    need to be stated in the ``init.lua`` file. It is recommended to use the default filenames
    as stated above.

    * **button.png** is used as the background for buttons and several other UI elements. The image is tiled to fit the element's width and height.
    * **windows/close.png** is used as the icon for the Close button in a window's top-right corner.
    * **windows/pin.png** is used as the icon for the Pin button in a window's top-left corner.
    * **windows/unpin.png** is used as the icon for the Unpin button in a pinned window's top-left corner.
    * **windows/minimize.png** is used as the icon for the minimize button in a window's top-left corner.
    * **windows/maximize.png** is used as the icon for the unminimize button in a minimized window's top-left corner.
    * **windows/background.png** is used as the window background. The image is tiled to fit the window's width and height.
    * **windows/top.png**, **windows/bottom.png**, **windows/left.png**, and **windows/right.png** are used as the window's upper, lower, left, and right border respectively. The images are tiled to fit the window's length.

**images/**
    This directory may contain replacement images for any image file located under the data directory's ``images`` directory.

``init.lua``
------------

This Lua script returns a table with descriptions for all UI elements. The table needs to contain the following keys:

* **minimum_font_size** (int): Fonts will not be scaled below this size.
* **minimap_icon_frame** (RGB): The color for the frame of minimap previews in the Choose Map/Savegame screens.
* **background_focused** (RGBA): The color for the focus overlays of the focused UI element.
* **background_semi_focused** (RGBA): The color for the focus overlays of the focused UI element's parent elements.
* **focus_border_thickness** (int): Thickness of the focus overlays of the focused UI element.
* **windows** (table): Style definitons for `windows`_
* **buttons** (table): Style definitons for `buttons`_
* **sliders** (table): Style definitons for `sliders`_
* **tabpanels** (table): Style definitons for `tabpanels`_
* **editboxes** (table): Style definitons for one-line and multi-line `editboxes`_
* **dropdowns** (table): Style definitons for `dropdowns`_
* **scrollbars** (table): Style definitons for `scrollbars`_
* **statistics_plot** (table): Style definitons for in-game `statistics plots`_
* **building_statistics** (table): Style definitons for the in-game `building statistics`_ menu
* **progressbar** (table): Style definitons for `progress bars`_

  .. versionadded:: 1.2

* **colors** (table): Style definitons for RGB `colors`_

  .. versionadded:: 1.2

* **styled_sizes** (table): Definitons for UI element `sizes`_ and text spacing

  .. versionadded:: 1.2

RGB colors are arrays with three entries representing the red, green, and blue components (in this order).
RGBA colors are arrays with four entries representing the red, green, blue, and alpha components (in this order).
Example:

.. code-block:: lua

   minimap_icon_frame = {255, 220, 0},
   background_focused = {240, 240, 240, 200},

Since version 1.2, it is no longer required to specify all styles in a theme. The corresponding
style from the default theme will be used for omitted styles. However, if a style is included,
its definition must be complete. Individual elements still cannot be overridden separately.

* **window_border_focused** (RGBA): The color to blend over the border of the window if it has focus.
* **window_border_unfocused** (RGBA): The color to blend over the border of the window if it does not have focus.
* **background**, **border_top**, **border_bottom**, **border_right**, **border_left**, **button_close**, **button_pin**, **button_unpin**, **button_minimize**, **button_unminimize** (strings): The paths to the corresponding icons. See above for the recommended directory structure.
