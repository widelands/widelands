Defining the World
==================

The world is bootstrapped with the following scripts:

* ``data/world/init.lua``: This file loads all the scripts that define the
  world. So, if you add a new unit to the world, it needs to be
  listed in this file.
* ``data/world/map_generation.lua``: This file is used by the random map generator.
