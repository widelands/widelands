Other Scripts
=============

The ``data/tribes/scripting`` directory provides some global scripts related to
the tribes. It contains the following subdirectories:

* ``data/tribes/scripting/help``: These scripts load all information used by the
  in-game help ('Tribal Encyclopedia'). Unit-specific help is loaded with the
  help of each unit's and tribe's ``helptexts.lua`` script.
