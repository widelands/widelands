Miscellaneous Lua Scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``data/tribes/scripting`` directory provides some global scripts related to
the tribes. It contains the following subdirectories:

* ``data/tribes/scripting/help``: These scripts load all information used by the
  in-game help ('Tribal Encyclopedia'). Unit-specific help is loaded with the
  help of each unit's and tribe's help texts defined in
  ``data/tribes/initialization/<tribe_name>/units.lua``.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 3

Naming Lists
------------

A user can define custom naming lists for ships and warehouses in their home directory.
The files are called ``ship_names`` and ``warehouse_names`` respectively and placed in the Widelands home directory.

Each file, if present and not empty, may define any number of names, with one name per line,
where each name can be used for all tribes or just some tribes.
The file is divided with section headers in brackets, where each header is a comma-separated list of tribes.
All names in this section are applied to only these tribes.
Names outside a section or in sections with an empty name apply to all tribes.
Example:

.. code-block:: ini

   All Tribes 1
   All Tribes 2

   [barbarians]
   Barbarians Only 1
   Barbarians Only 2

   [empire, barbarians, amazons]
   This name applies to these three tribes
