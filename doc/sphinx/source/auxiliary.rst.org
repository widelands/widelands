Auxiliary Scripts
=================

Some Lua scripts come bundled with Widelands (in the ``data/scripting/``
directory). They can be imported in any script by calling :func:`include`,
followed by the path relative to the ``data`` directory. Most of these scripts
provide some convenience functionality around the core functions that are easier
to use or offer more flexibility. All functions are imported into the global
namespace. All auxiliary scripts are documented in this section.
