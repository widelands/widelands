Roadmap
=======

New features will be implemented on a per need basis. If you find that the
current Lua abstractions can't do anything you want to do, please file a bug
report and chances are someone will implement these features.

Currently unimplemented features
--------------------------------

These are feature which are currently not implemented. If they will be
implemented depends on how useful they are. If you want anything implemented,
please open a bug report and this will be pushed.

* Access to constructionsites via ``Player.get_buildings``.
* Creating busy roads and second carriers on them.
* Allow and forbid worker types. Currently all workers are always allowed.
* Access to bobs, workers. Directly control worker's working stack. This would
  allow to send bobs to specific map locations via the API.
