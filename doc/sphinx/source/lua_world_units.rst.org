Defining Units
==============

A world can have the following types of units:

* **Critters**: Animals that will move around the map at random
* **Immovables**: Trees, rocks, artifacts and eye candy
* **Resources**: Mineable map resources like fish, water, coal, ...
* **Terrains**: The base of the landscape. Meadows, mountains, water...

The definitions for the world's units are located in the subdirectories of
``data/world``. Each unit needs to have an ``init.lua`` file, which will load the unit to be used in the game.
