README for the Documentation
============================

This file contains the developer and content creator documentation for
Widelands. The documentation is generated with sphinx, you need to install this
if you want to build the documentation (modules py-sphinx or similar).

Building the documentation for offline reading
----------------------------------------------

First, extract the embedded documentation from the C++ and Lua code::

   $ cd doc/sphinx/
   $ ./extract_rst.py [-graphs]

The option ``-graphs`` adds dependency graphs for each class.

Then, run ``make`` to see your options. Convenient for off-line reading is
``make html``.


Building the documentation for the webserver
--------------------------------------------

For building the documentation for the webserver, see the README.txt
of the widelands-website project.
