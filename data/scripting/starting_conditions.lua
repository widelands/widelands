-- RST
-- .. function:: sleep_then_goto(player, sleeptime, field)
--
--    Wait for the given number of milliseconds, then center the
--    interactive player's map view on the given Field.
--
--    This function returns immediately after calling.
--
--    :arg player: The player to move the view for
--    :arg sleeptime: The number of milliseconds to wait
--    :arg field: The `wl.map.Field` to center the view on
--
--    :returns: :const:`nil`

      sleep(sleeptime)
      if player.number == wl.Game().interactive_player then scroll_to_field(field) end
   end)
end

-- RST
-- .. function:: launch_expeditions(player, items)
--
--    Creates some expedition ships in random places with the
--    given additional items on them. If called for the interactive
--    player, centers the view on an arbitrary of these ships.
--
--    :arg player: The `wl.game.Player` to use
--    :arg items: An array of tables with `ware_or_worker_name = amount` pairs. As many ships will
--                be created as there are subtables, and the n-th ship created will load the
--                additional wares and workers defined in `items[n]`. The capacity of each ship will
--                be adjusted to accommodate the build cost of the player's tribe's port building
--                plus one builder plus the number of additional items for this ship.
--
--    :returns: :const:`nil`
