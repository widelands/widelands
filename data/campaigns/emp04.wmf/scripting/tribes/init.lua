-- Scenario-Specific Units
-- -----------------------
--
-- When writing a scenario, you can create custom tribe objects for it.
-- At the moment, we support buildings, wares and workers.
-- If you need support for other types of tribe units, please open a new bug report.
--
-- For creating scenario-specific tribe objects, create a subdirectory
-- ``scripting/tribes`` in your map.
-- In that subdirectory, place a file called ``init.lua``.
-- This file needs to return a table listing all the objects that the tribes do
-- not have by default. You can also add helptexts. For example:
--
-- .. code-block:: lua
--
--    return {
--       empire = {
--          buildings = {
--             {
--                name = "empire_brewery1",
--                helptexts = {
--                   purpose = pgettext("empire_building", "Produces beer to keep the miners strong and happy.")
--                }
--             },
--             name = "empire_trainingcamp1",
--                helptexts = {
--                   purpose = {
--                      pgettext("empire_building", "Trains soldiers in ‘Attack’ and in ‘Health’."),
--                      pgettext("empire_building", "Equips the soldiers with all necessary weapons and armor parts.")
--                   },
--                   note = pgettext("empire_building", "Imperial soldiers cannot be trained in ‘Defense’ and will remain at the level with which they came.")
--                }
--             },
--             {
--                name = "empire_temple_of_vesta",
--                helptexts = {
--                   purpose = pgettext("empire_building", "In the temple of Vesta, the wares to worship are stored. It is the home of the priestesses and the guards of the goddess.")
--                }
--             }
--          }
--          workers_order = {
--             {
--                {
--                   name = "empire_vesta_priestess",
--                   default_target_quantity = 1,
--                   preciousness = 15
--                }
--             },
--          },
--          wares_order = {
--             {
--                {
--                   name = "empire_vesta_wine"
--                   default_target_quantity = 10,
--                   preciousness = 4
--                }
--             },
--          }
--       },
--       frisians = {
--          buildings = {
--             { name = "frisians_warehouse1" }
--          }
--       }
--    }
--
-- If you are only replacing already existing objects, you can skip adding the
-- ``init.lua`` file.
--
-- Now place your custom tribe objects into subdirectories below ``scripting/tribes``:
--
-- * In each subdirectory, there needs to be an ``init.lua`` file that adds all
--   objects for that subdirectory.
--   If an object has the same name as an already existing tribe object,
--   it will replace that tribe object.
-- * You will also need to add a ``register.lua`` file that lists the names of all
--   objects that you are adding or replacing.
-- * You can also add ``.png`` files to your subdirectories.
-- * Adding helptexts is optional, but will units without a helptext will print a warning on the console.
--
-- See :ref:`defining_tribe_units` for further details on these files, and :ref:`lua_tribes_tribes_helptexts` on the helptext format.

-- For formatting time strings
include "tribes/scripting/help/time_strings.lua"
