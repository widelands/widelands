   This is a village of poor but friendly people who have settled in a safe
   valley between two glaciers. They hunt and produce timber and grain but they
   do not have ores or even stones, so they are dependent on the infrequent
   merchant that may pass by and provide them with whatever they cannot
   produce on their own. Their only protection is a guard hut at each entrance
   to the valley. Therefore they realize that they may have to join a more
   powerful society for protection in order to stay alive in this world.

   A user that explores the map far from home will discover this village as a
   bonus. Doing so is not necessary for winning. The village can still be found
   when the scenario is already won.

   Technically the village is created instantly when the player sees any of the
   two entrances to the valley. But we place some trees and fields in various
   stages of growth to make it seem like the village has actually existed for
   some time. Some land ownership adjustments are made to ensure that the
   village owns all land between the glaciers.
