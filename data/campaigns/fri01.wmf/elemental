name=_"The Great Stormflood"
author="Nordfriese"
descr=_"In 1362, the quiet, peaceful life of the inhabitants of the Northern Frisian Islands was disrupted by one of the greatest storm floods in human memory: Saint Marcellusâ€™ Flood. Is it really nothing more than yet another storm, or a sign from the Gods that the Frisian community on the island of Langeness is not wanted here?"
hint=_"This scenario is set in a historical context, but most of the story line is fiction."
