-- Bootstrapping a Tribe
-- ---------------------
--
-- Each tribe needs to have some basic information defined for displaying it in menus
-- and for loading its game starting conditions.
-- The file **has to be located in** ``tribes/initialization/<tribename>/init.lua`` so that the engine can find it.
--
-- This file returns a table with the basic information for a tribe that is
-- needed before a game is loaded or the editor has been started. The table has the following entries:
--
-- * **name**: A string containing the internal name of the tribe
-- * **author**: The creator(s) of the tribe
-- * **descname**: In-game display name of the tribe
-- * **tooltip**: A description of the tribe to be shown in tooltips
-- * **icon**: File path to a png file to be used as button image
-- * **script**: File path to the :ref:`units.lua <lua_tribes_tribes_units>` file
--   that configures which units the tribe is using
-- * **starting_conditions**: A table of file paths to starting condition Lua scripts
--

-- And now the documentation for this file

--
-- Configuring a Tribe's Units Usage
-- ---------------------------------
--
-- The ``tribes/initialization/<tribename>/units.lua`` file configures the units that a tribe can use.
--
-- .. function:: new_tribe{table}
--
--    This function adds all units to a tribe.
--
--    :arg table: This table contains all the data that the game engine will add to the tribe.
--                It contains the following entries:
--
--    **name**: A string containing the internal name of the tribe.
--
--    **animations**: Global animations. Contains subtables for ``frontier`` and ``flag``.
--    Each animation needs the parameter ``hotspot`` (2 integer coordinates),
--    and may also define ``fps`` (integer frames per second).
--
--    **animation_directory**: The location of the animation png files.
--
--    **bridges**: Contains animations for ``normal_e``, ``normal_se``, ``normal_sw``,
--    ``busy_e``, ``busy_se`` and ``busy_sw``.
--
--    **bridge_height**: The height in pixels of each bridge at it's summit at 1x scale.
--
--    **roads**: The file paths for the tribe's road textures in 3 subtables ``busy``,
--    ``normal`` and ``waterway``.
--
--    **resource_indicators**: The names for the resource indicators.
--    This table contains a subtable for each resource name plus a subtable named
--    ``""`` for no resources. Each subtable is an array, in which the index of
--    each entry is the highest amount of resources the indicator may indicate.
--
--    **wares_order**: This defines all the wares that this tribe uses and their
--    display order in the user interface. Each subtable defines a column in the
--    user interface, and in a current development version it contains subtables
--    in turn for each ware referenced. The subtables define the ware's ``name``,
--    ``default_target_quantity``, ``preciousness``, and :ref:`lua_tribes_tribes_helptexts`,
--    like this:
--
--    .. code-block:: lua
--
--       wares_order = {
--          {
--             -- Building Materials
--             {
--                name = "granite",
--                default_target_quantity = 20,
--                preciousness = 5,
--                helptexts = {
--                   purpose = pgettext("ware", "Granite is a basic building material.")
--                }
--             },
--             {
--               ...
--
--    The meaning of the ware parameters is as follows:
--
--       **name**: A string containing the internal name of this ware.
--
--       **default_target_quantity**: *Optional* The default target quantity
--       for the tribe's economy.
--       If not set, the economy will always demand this ware.
--       If set to zero, the economy will not demand this ware unless it is required
--       in a production building.
--       If not set or set to zero, the actual target quantity will not be available
--       in the economy settings window.
--
--       **preciousness**: How precious this ware is to this tribe.
--       We recommend not going higher than ``50``.
--
--    **workers_order**:  This defines all the workers that this tribe uses and their
--    display order in the user interface. Each subtable defines a column in the user
--    interface, and in a current development version it contains subtables
--    in turn for each worker referenced. The subtables define the worker's ``name``,
--    ``default_target_quantity``, ``preciousness`` and :ref:`lua_tribes_tribes_helptexts`,
--    like this:
--
--    .. code-block:: lua
--
--       workers_order = {
--          {
--             -- Carriers
--             {
--                name = "atlanteans_carrier",
--                helptexts = {
--                   purpose = pgettext("atlanteans_worker", "Carries items along your roads.")
--                }
--             },
--             { name = "atlanteans_ferry" },
--             {
--                name = "atlanteans_horse",
--                default_target_quantity = 10,
--                preciousness = 2
--             },
--             { name = "atlanteans_horsebreeder" }
--          },
--          {
--               ...
--
--    The meaning of the worker parameters is the same as for the wares, but
--    both ``default_target_quantity`` and ``preciousness`` are optional.
--    However, when ``default_target_quantity`` has been set, you will also need
--    to set ``preciousness``.
--
--    **immovables**: This defines the name and :ref:`lua_tribes_tribes_helptexts`
--    for all the immovables that this tribe uses, like this:
--
--    .. code-block:: lua
--
--       immovables = {
--          {
--             name = "ashes",
--             helptexts = {
--                purpose = _("The remains of a destroyed building.")
--             }
--          },
--          {
--             ...
--       }
--
--    **buildings**: This defines the name and :ref:`lua_tribes_tribes_helptexts`
--    for all the buildings that this tribe uses and their display order in the user interface, like this:
--
--    .. code-block:: lua
--
--       buildings = {
--          {
--             name = "atlanteans_shipyard",
--             helptexts = {
--                purpose = pgettext("building", "Constructs ships that are used for overseas colonization and for trading between ports.")
--             }
--          },
--       }
--
--    **builder**:  The internal name of the tribe's builder. This unit needs to be defined in the ``workers_order`` table too.
--
--    **carrier**:  The internal name of the tribe's carrier. This unit needs to be defined in the ``workers_order`` table too.
--
--    **carrier2**:  The internal name of the tribe's beast of burden. This unit needs to be defined in the ``workers_order`` table too.
--
--    **geologist**:  The internal name of the tribe's geologist. This unit needs to be defined in the ``workers_order`` table too.
--
--    **soldier**: The internal name of the tribe's soldier. This unit needs to be defined in the ``workers_order`` table too.
--
--    **ship**: The internal name of the tribe's ship.
--
--    **ferry**: The internal name of the tribe's ferry.
--
--    **port**: The internal name of the tribe's port building. This unit needs to be defined in the ``buildings`` table too.
--
--    **toolbar**: *Optional*. Replace the default toolbar images with these custom images. Example:
--
--    .. code-block:: lua
--
--       toolbar = {
--          left_corner = dirname .. "images/atlanteans/toolbar_left_corner.png",
--          left = dirname .. "images/atlanteans/toolbar_left.png", -- Will be tiled
--          center = dirname .. "images/atlanteans/toolbar_center.png",
--          right = dirname .. "images/atlanteans/toolbar_right.png", -- Will be tiled
--          right_corner = dirname .. "images/atlanteans/toolbar_right_corner.png"
--       }

-- .. _lua_tribes_tribes_helptexts:

-- Helptexts
-- ---------
--
-- Helptexts are used in the Tribal Encyclopedia to give the users some basic

--             note = pgettext("barbarians_building", "The Barbarian ax workshop is the intermediate production site in a series of three buildings. It is enhanced from the metal workshop but doesn’t require additional qualification for the worker."),
--
--             performance = {
--                -- Performance helptext for a barbarian production site: Ax Workshop, part 1
--                pgettext("barbarians_building", "If all needed wares are delivered in time, this building can produce each type of ax in about %s on average."):bformat(ngettext("%d second", "%d seconds", 57):bformat(57)),

--
-- * All units should have a ``purpose`` helptext, but this is not enforced by the engine.
-- * Empty helptexts are allowed, although they will log a warning to the console to
--   help you find missing helptexts.
-- * ``lore``, ``lore_author`` and ``note`` are only used by buildings,
--   ``performance`` is only used by training site and production site buildings.
-- * We recommend that you use ``pgettext`` to disambiguate the strings for the different tribes.
-- * To make life easier for our translators, you can split long helptexts into multiple entries
--   as with the ``performance`` example above.
--   The helptexts are then joined by the engine.
--   In our example, we will get *"If all needed wares are delivered in time, this building can produce each type of ax in about 57 seconds on average. All three weapons take the same time for making, but the required raw materials vary."*
