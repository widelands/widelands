--
-- This file contains all the units for a tribe.
--
-- .. function:: new_tribe{table}
--
--    This function adds all units to a tribe.
--
--    :arg table: This table contains all the data that the game engine will add to the tribe.
--                It contains the following entries:
--
--    **name**: A string containing the internal name of the tribe.
--
--    **animations**: Global animations. Contains subtables for ``frontier`` and ``flag``. Each animation needs the parameters ``pictures`` (table of filenames) and ``hotspot`` (2 integer coordinates), and may also define ``fps`` (integer frames per second).
--
--    **animation_directory**: The location of the animation png files.
--
--    **bridges**: Contains animations for ``normal_e``, ``normal_se``, ``normal_sw``, ``busy_e``, ``busy_se`` and ``busy_sw``.
--
--    **bridge_height**: The height in pixels of each bridge at it's summit at 1x scale.
--
--    **roads**: The file paths for the tribe's road textures in 3 subtables ``busy``, ``normal`` and ``waterway``.
--
--    **resource_indicators**: The names for the resource indicators. This table contains a subtable for each resource name plus a subtable named "" for no resources. Each subtable is an array, in which the index of each entry is the highest amount of resources the indicator may indicate.
--
--    **wares_order**: This defines all the wares that this tribe uses and their display order in the user interface. Each subtable defines a column in the user interface.
--
--    **workers_order**:  This defines all the workers that this tribe uses and their display order in the user interface. Each subtable defines a column in the user interface.
--
--    **immovables**: This defines all the immovables that this tribe uses.
--
--    **buildings**: This defines all the buildings that this tribe uses and their display order in the user interface.
--
--    **ship_names**: A list of strings with ship names presented to the user - be creative :)
--
--    **builder**:  The internal name of the tribe's builder. This unit needs to be defined in the ``workers_order`` table too.
--
--    **carrier**:  The internal name of the tribe's carrier. This unit needs to be defined in the ``workers_order`` table too.
--
--    **carrier2**:  The internal name of the tribe's beast of burden. This unit needs to be defined in the ``workers_order`` table too.
--
--    **geologist**:  The internal name of the tribe's geologist. This unit needs to be defined in the ``workers_order`` table too.
--
--    **soldier**: The internal name of the tribe's soldier. This unit needs to be defined in the ``workers_order`` table too.
--
--    **ship**: The internal name of the tribe's ship.
--
--    **ferry**: The internal name of the tribe's ferry.
--
--    **port**: The internal name of the tribe's port building. This unit needs to be defined in the ``buildings`` table too.
--
--    **toolbar**: *Optional*. Replace the default toolbar images with these custom images. Example:
--
--    .. code-block:: lua
--
--       toolbar = {
--          left_corner = dirname .. "images/atlanteans/toolbar_left_corner.png",
--          left = dirname .. "images/atlanteans/toolbar_left.png", -- Will be tiled
--          center = dirname .. "images/atlanteans/toolbar_center.png",
--          right = dirname .. "images/atlanteans/toolbar_right.png", -- Will be tiled
--          right_corner = dirname .. "images/atlanteans/toolbar_right_corner.png"
