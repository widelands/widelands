-- Military Sites
-- --------------
--
-- Militarysites are a type of building that can house soldiers and that expand the players' terrain.
-- They can also be attacked.
--
-- Militarysites are defined in
-- ``data/tribes/buildings/militarysites/<tribe_name>/<building_name>/init.lua``.
-- The building will also need its help texts, which are defined in
-- ``data/tribes/buildings/militarysites/<tribe_name>/<building_name>/helptexts.lua``
--
-- .. function:: new_militarysite_type{table}
--
--    This function adds the definition of a military site building to the engine.
--
--    :arg table: This table contains all the data that the game engine will add to this building.
--                In addition to the :ref:`lua_tribes_buildings_common`, it contains the following entries:
--
--    **max_soldiers**
--        *Mandatory*. The maximum number of solders that can be garrisoned at this building.
--
--    **heal_per_second**
--        *Mandatory*. The number of health points that a garrisoned soldier will heal each second.
--
--    **conquers**
--        *Mandatory*. The conquer radius for this building.
--
--    **prefer_heroes**
--        *Mandatory*. Whether this building prefers heroes or rookies per default.
--        Set to ``true`` or ``false``.
--
--    **messages**
--        *Mandatory*. Messages that this building will send to the user. There are 5 messages,
--        defined like this::
--
--            messages = {
--                occupied = _"Your soldiers have occupied your fortress.",
--                aggressor = _"Your fortress discovered an aggressor.",
--                attack = _"Your fortress is under attack.",
--                defeated_enemy = _"The enemy defeated your soldiers at the fortress.",
--                defeated_you = _"Your soldiers defeated the enemy at the fortress."
--            }
--
-- For making the UI texts translateable, we also need to push/pop the correct textdomain.

--    push_textdomain("tribes")
