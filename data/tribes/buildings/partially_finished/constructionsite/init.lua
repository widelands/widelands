-- Construction Sites
-- ------------------
--
-- The constructionsite is a special building.
-- It is a building site where a building is being constructed.
-- Just like the dismantlesite, it is defined only once for all tribes.
--
-- The constructionsite is defined in
-- ``buildings/partially_finished/constructionsite/init.lua``.
-- The building will also need its help texts, which are defined in
-- ``buildings/partially_finished/constructionsite/helptexts.lua``
--
-- .. function:: new_constructionsite_type{table}
--
--    This function adds the definition of the construction site building to the engine.
--
--    :arg table: This table contains all the data that the game engine will add to this building.
--                It only contains :ref:`lua_tribes_buildings_common`.
--
-- For making the UI texts translateable, we also need to push/pop the correct textdomain.
--
-- Example:
--
-- .. code-block:: lua
--
--    push_textdomain("tribes")
--
--    dirname = path.dirname(__file__)
--
--    descriptions:new_constructionsite_type {
--       name = "constructionsite",
--       descname = pgettext("building", "Construction Site"),
--       animation_directory = dirname,
--       icon = dirname .. "menu.png",
--       vision_range = 2,
--
--       animations = {
--          idle = {
--             hotspot = { 5, 5 },
--          },
--          idle_with_worker = {
--             hotspot = { 33, 36 },
--          }
--       },
--
--       aihints = {},
--    }
--
--    pop_textdomain()
