-- The dismantlesite is a special building.
-- It is a building site where a building is being dismantled.
-- Just like the constructionsite, it is defined only once for all tribes.
--
-- The dismantlesite is defined in
-- ``buildings/partially_finished/dismantlesite/init.lua``.
-- The building will also need its help texts, which are defined in
-- ``buildings/partially_finished/dismantlesite/helptexts.lua``

-- .. function:: new_dismantlesite_type{table}

--
--    :arg table: This table contains all the data that the game engine will add to this building.
--                It only contains :ref:`lua_tribes_buildings_common`.
