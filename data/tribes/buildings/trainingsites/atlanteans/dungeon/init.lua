-- Training Sites
-- --------------
--
-- Trainingsites are a special type of productionsite building where soldiers are
-- housed and wares are being consumed to train the soldiers to better levels.
-- They also have workers working at them.
--
-- Trainingsites are defined in
-- ``data/tribes/buildings/trainingsites/<tribe_name>/<building_name>/init.lua``.
-- The building will also need its help texts, which are defined in
-- ``data/tribes/buildings/trainingsites/<tribe_name>/<building_name>/helptexts.lua``

-- .. function:: new_trainingsite_type{table}
--
--    This function adds the definition of a training site building to the engine.
--
--    :arg table: This table contains all the data that the game engine will add to this building.
--                It is a special type of production site, so it has all the entries that :ref:`lua_tribes_buildings_productionsites` can have, plus the following entries:
--
--    **soldier_capacity**
--        *Mandatory*. An int describing how many soldiers this building can house.
--
--    **trainer_patience**
--        *Mandatory*. An int describing how patient the trainer is.
--        If trainer patience runs out, a soldier will be kicked out.
--
--    **soldier attack**
--        *Optional*. A table describing what is needed to train a soldier in attack.
--        It contains the following entries:
--
--        **min_level**
--            *Mandatory*. The minimum attack level that a soldier needs before it
--            can be trained in attack at this training site.
--
--        **max_level**
--            *Mandatory*. The maximum level of attack that a soldier can be trained in.
--
--        **food**
--            *Optional*. A table with the types of food needed to train a
--            soldier in attack. It contains subtables with alternatives, e.g.
--            ``{"fish", "meat"}`` means that fish OR meat is needed,
--            ``{"fish"}, {"meat"}`` means that fish AND meat are needed.
--
--        **weapons**
--            *Optional*. A table with the list of weapons that are used for
--            attack training at the various levels.
--
--        Example::
--
--            ["soldier attack"] = {
--                min_level = 0,
--                max_level = 3,
--                food = {
--                    {"smoked_fish", "smoked_meat"},
--                    {"atlanteans_bread"}
--                },
--                weapons = {
--                    "trident_long",
--                    "trident_steel",
--                    "trident_double",
--                    "trident_heavy_double"
--                }
--            },
--
--    **soldier defense**
--            *Optional*. Just like ``soldier attack``, but for defense training.
--
--    **soldier health**
--            *Optional*. Just like ``soldier attack``, but for health training.
--
--    **soldier evade**
--            *Optional*. Just like ``soldier attack``, but for evade training.
