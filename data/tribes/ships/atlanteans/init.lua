-- Ships
-- -----
--
-- Each tribe can have one ship that is used to explore the seas and transport
-- wares between ports.
--
-- Ships are defined in
-- ``data/tribes/ships/<tribe_name>/init.lua``.
--
-- .. function:: new_ship_type(table)
--
--    This function adds the definition of a ship to the engine.
--
--    :arg table: This table contains all the data that the game engine will
--                add to this ship. It contains the following entries:
--
--    **name**: A string containing the internal name of this ship.
--
--    **descname**: The translatable display name. Use ``pgettext`` to fetch the string.
--
--    **icon**: Path to the menu icon file.
--
--    **capacity**: An int defining how many wares or workers this ship can transport
--
--    **vision_range**: How far the ship can see.
--
--    **animations**: A table containing all animations for this ship.
--    Ships have an "idle", a "sinking" and a directional "sail" animation.
--
--    **names**: A list of strings with ship names presented to the user - be creative :)
--
-- For making the UI texts translateable, we also need to push/pop the correct textdomain.
--
-- Example:
--
-- .. code-block:: lua
--
--    push_textdomain("tribes")
--
--    dirname = path.dirname(__file__)
--
--    descriptions:new_ship_type {
--       name = "atlanteans_ship",
--       descname = pgettext("atlanteans_ship", "Ship"),
--       animation_directory = dirname,
--       icon = dirname .. "menu.png",
--       capacity = 30,
--       vision_range = 4,
--
--       animations = {
--          idle = {
--             hotspot = { 89, 86 },
--             fps = 10
