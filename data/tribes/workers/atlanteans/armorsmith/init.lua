-- Workers
-- --------
--
-- Workers of this basic type work in buildings. Their function is defined either
-- through the :ref:`buildings' programs <productionsite_programs>`, or through their :ref:`own programs <tribes_worker_programs>`.
--
-- Workers are defined in
-- ``data/tribes/workers/<tribe name>/<worker_name>/init.lua``.
-- The worker will also need its :ref:`help texts <lua_tribes_workers_helptexts>`,
-- which are defined in ``data/tribes/wares/<tribe name>/<worker_name>/helptexts.lua``.
--
-- .. function:: new_worker_type{table}
--
--    This function adds the definition of a worker to the engine.
--
--    :arg table: This table contains all the data that the game engine will add
--                to this worker. It contains the properties in
--                :ref:`lua_tribes_workers_common`.
