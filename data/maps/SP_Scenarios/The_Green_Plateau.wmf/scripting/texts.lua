We have discovered enemy positions held by Erwyn to the north and east of the castle. He is known to be a strong warlord and surely commands the strongest warriors. In the south, we caught sight of some food infrastructures guarded by Jomo – a younger warlord – and we should take care of those infrastructures so we can cut off our enemies’ food supply.]])))
