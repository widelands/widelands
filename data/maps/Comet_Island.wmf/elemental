descr=_"A few miles in front of Gerion Coast lies a small unnamed island. Until now, you have not seen any reason to sail there, but yesterday a big fireball came from the sky and touched down in its center. Is this a sign of the Gods? You believe it is and you hope that your tribe will find the treasure of this island before other tribes will follow."
hint=_"Red player is close to the ores, but has little fertile terrain. Yellow player has plenty of good land, but must move far from his starting position to find ores. Blue player takes the middle ground – he has some fertile land and is not too far away from the resources."
