descr=_"The jewel of the alps, the dolomites mountain range has been declared a world heritage site for its pristine beauty. This map is an as-faithful-as-reasonable reconstruction of the area delimited by Cortina d'Ampezzo in the north-east and Canazei in the south-west. If you have to be pitted in a duel to the death with your enemies, it may as well be in a beautiful place."
hint=_"- there is lot of flat ground on the mountains. Unfortunately, most of it is vertical. Use wisely the little building space you have. - A fortress at the mouth of a narrow mountain pass can be a formidable obstacle to an enemy army. Use the terrain to your advantage - chop all trees and expand wherever you can; it's the only way to find all the precious farm spaces - suggested teams: red+orange+blue+violet"
