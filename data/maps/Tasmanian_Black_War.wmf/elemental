name=_"Tasmanian Black War"
author="Solstice"
descr=_"Welcome, intruder! You’re like a European conqueror from the early 1800s when they settled the Van Diemen land – later known as Tasmania. Between 1828 and 1832 there was a war called the Black War in which the British Empire eradicated almost the entire Aboriginal population of the Van Diemen land. – The map simulates a scattered British Empire but without any advantages – actually it offers some great disadvantages and you will likely have a hard time conquering Tasmania. During the historical Black War the ratio between Europeans and Aboriginals was around one against ten, but this time they’re armed to the teeth for a rematch."
hint=_"This map is intended to be played by a single player from the blue player’s starting location as Empire. Choose Barbarians and Amazons for the rival tribes. If you want a challenge, put them all on the same side and disable Diplomacy. Or you can play with every player against all others, with a win condition of Territorial Time. This map isn’t suitable for short games and one game will likely take more than ten hours. The AI has great capability on this map. One of the computer players will likely also begin seafaring and competing for the best harbor places on the Tasmanian coast, so you’ve been warned!"
