descr=_"This map is intended as a solo challenge for those very skilled players that find 1v6 against the AI too easy.  Blue player has no metal (except a bit of iron to kickstart your economy), so you have to rely on the 5% production of an empty mine. And you're still 1v6 (though of course you can remove some AI players to make it a bit easier). Good luck"
