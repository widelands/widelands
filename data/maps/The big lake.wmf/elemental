descr=_"This island once appeared out of the deepest depths of the sea. In those days, fire rose out of the salty seawater and brought ash, stones and soil to light. And the fire came nearer and nearer to the sun, while the mountain grew and grew. Until one day, when the whole fire mountain exploded. Nowadays only this ring is left from that mighty fire mountain. Do you think that it is big enough for more than one tribe?"
