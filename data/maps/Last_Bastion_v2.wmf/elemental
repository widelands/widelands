descr=_"The whimsical Gods didn’t answer our prayers. Instead, the increasing sunlight heated up the Earth a thousandfold and melted glaciers and people were plunged into the deep. But now – high in the majestic mountains, on the last scrap of land – two surviving tribes are sheltering. Even though the Gods showed mercy and the climate thus turned cooler again, the water is still rising and rising. Onto the last secure place – the highest mountain range where the amount of gold and the space to live merely suffice for one tribe – only two opposite paths lead. But remember, be careful… this last living space is also a hard and small place to live."
hint=_"Don’t forget to take care of your timber supplies, you’ll need them."
