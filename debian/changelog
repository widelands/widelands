widelands (1:19+repack-6widelands1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Changed build dependencies:
      - New build dependencies required:
        libboost-system-dev
      - No longer needed:
        libsdl2-net-dev
      - Also dropped version-specific glew alternative.
        1.6 doesn't seem to be around anymore and the versionless one
        seems to work across the different distro releases we build for
  * Build with ASAN disabled since parts of the code atm breaks
  * Various minor typo and whitespace fixes
  * Removed deprecated Applications category from desktop file
  * Updated appdata: enable content_rating
  * Updated appdata: added icon
  * Additional translations for appdata and desktop file.
  * Update copyright year from 2013 to 2018.
  * Merged Debian packaging of Widelands 1:19+repack-6. Remaining changes:
    - Revert debhelper/compat level to 9. (Ubuntu 14.04 doesn't have debhelper 10.)
    - Disabled all Debian-patches since applying them might cause conflicts as
      development moves along in latest trunk. They mostly concern
      architectures which we don't have access to build/test with normally, so
      they would be hard to maintain.
    - Dropped patches:
        gcc7 
          (Already applied in trunk)
        system-wide_minizip
          (Should be included in trunk once we iron out the remaining bugs)
        widelands_ICU_63.1
          (Already applied in trunk)
    - Build using embedded minizip since we support older Ubuntu releases where
      the package is not available.
    - .stub-files to make widelands.desktop and appdata localizable.
    - Re-added font entries to copyright file, since we will most likely be using
      the embedded fonts.
    - Modified rules to use our embedded fonts and install all binaries.
    - Comment out get-orig-source. We just want to build current trunk

  * New upstream release. New features highlight:
    - Seafaring AI and other AI improvements
    - Message filtering
    - New in-game and in-editor help system
    - Efficient graphics loading and rendering.
    - New starting condition “Trading Outpost”
    - New win condition “Artifacts”
    - 4 Tutorials
    - Improved Barbarians and Empire campaigns
    - 3 new maps
    - No separate worlds anymore. All terrains can now be used on all
      maps. Old maps stay compatible.
    - No separate tribes anymore: Though in game the tribes still seem
      separate, they are in fact now the same tribe with different
      buildings and workers enabled. This allows for interesting
      concepts down the line like a mixed economy or trading.
    - New animations, overlay images and icons
    - New forested mountains terrains
    - Many menu redesigns
    - Improved support for non-Latin scripts and right-to-left languages
    - Various small balance changes (for example more experience in mines,
      stronger barbarian soldiers)
    - Behind the scenes: move to SDL 2, Build system refactoring, move to
      c++ 11, continuous integration, move to Transifex and merge bot.
      Also tons of cleanups to the code base.

  * Package is manually repacked to mv debian/ debian.orig/ in
    upstream tar file.
  * Change the build-dependencies of SDL to the one of SDL2
  * Update our patches:
    - Drop patch kfreebsd-integrated-libraries (integrated upstream)
    - Comment mips and s390 patches: they may be useless nowadays
  * Take the new man page from the upstream debian package.
  * Take the new copyright file from upstream debian package.
  * New d/watch file by Steven De Herdt (Closes: #844005)
  * New d/p/system-wide_minizip to not use the embeeded minizip
    (provided by upstream developpers)
  * d/control: Bump standards-version to 3.9.8 (remove menu file)

    - Always use our bundled fonts
    - Updated copyright file
    - Updated man page
    - Moved all data-related directories into a new "data" directory.

widelands (build10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - closes #388406: Core dump during second mission.
      Fixed in upstream svn rev 1078.
    - closes #345451: Segfault on victory.
      Forwarded upstream and solved at some point.
    - closes #345217: save dialog box counter-intuitive
      Forwarded upstream and solved at some point.
    - closes #345386: --coredump option use is not intuitive.
      Was marked fixed-upstream in debian since a while
    - The building mecanism was completely changed upstream.
      Completely redo the packaging.
  * Drop the most of the patches since they were integrated upstream.
    Only locale is still there, but this is because upstream hardcoded
    a path in the game...

widelands (build8.cvs050107-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Let's make CVS builds really usefull to devel"
  * Update to the lastest CVS state.
  * Add a wrapper to the CVS builds which captures all informations
    developpers need to debug the problem the users will run into:
     - any core generated
     - the prog output
     - the record file (mouse movements, key press, etc. during the game)
     - package version (as reported by dpkg)
     - architecture (uname -a)
    Those information are placed in /tmp and when widelands exits with
    errcode, the user is prompted to report those information to the right
    BTS. They are not sent automatically.
  * To help Holger and friends tracking the issues, also generate a
    widelands-dbg package for CVS builds. It contains the debugging symbol,
    so that gdb can find them when the package is installed.
  * Please note that none of those CVS build features are used while building
    a release version (difference: "cvs" in version name).
    For that, debian/control is now generated by cdbs.
