widelands (1:18-3widelands1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Merged Debian packaging of Widelands 1:18-3. Remaining changes:
    - Disabled all Debian-patches since some caused conflicts when applied to 
      latest trunk. They mostly concern architectures which we don't have
      access to build/test with normally, so they would be hard to maintain.
        - The kFreeBSD-patch was removed entirely since it has been included.
    - Build dependencies changed from SDL to SDL2.
    - New build dependencies: boost-regex, boost-test
    - Removed build dependencies: lua, sdl(2)-gfx
    - Reduce complexity by reducing the number of paths configured during build
      to just the datadir. 
    - Install new binaries; wl_map_info, wl_map_object_info and wl_render_richtext
    - Always use our bundled fonts
    - Updated copyright file
    - Updated man page
    - Moved all data-related directories into a new "data" directory.
      Various paths have been updated to reflect this.
    - Added added widelands.appdata.xml for debian desktops. 
    - Made widelands.desktop localizable.
    - Translations for appdata and desktop file.

widelands (build8.cvs050107-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Let's make CVS builds really usefull to devel"
  * Update to the lastest CVS state.
  * Add a wrapper to the CVS builds which captures all informations
    developpers need to debug the problem the users will run into:
     - any core generated
     - the prog output
     - the record file (mouse movements, key press, etc. during the game)
     - package version (as reported by dpkg)
     - architecture (uname -a)
    Those information are placed in /tmp and when widelands exits with
    errcode, the user is prompted to report those information to the right
    BTS. They are not sent automatically.
  * To help Holger and friends tracking the issues, also generate a
    widelands-dbg package for CVS builds. It contains the debugging symbol,
    so that gdb can find them when the package is installed.
  * Please note that none of those CVS build features are used while building
    a release version (difference: "cvs" in version name).
    For that, debian/control is now generated by cdbs.
